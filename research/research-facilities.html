                <strong>The clinical nutrition laboratory</strong> is equipped with an array of state-of-the-art analytical instruments,
                such as headspace GC-FID, GC-MS, HPLC-DAD, and UHPLC-DAD, etc. Our researchers and graduate students are
                capable of determining and characterizing a wide range of nutrients (e.g., vitamins and amino acids), phytosterols,
                antioxidants, flavonoids and their metabolites. The clinical nutrition lab provides an excellent training environment for graduate
                students.

                <strong>The clinical research unit</strong> comprises a reception lounge, clinic rooms, a sample preparation area
                and a meeting room equipped with an observation mirror and an audio/video system. The room is suitable for
                conducting small focus-group meetings, and behaviour and consumer studies. In addition, the unit is also
                equipped with many clinical research tools, including a bioimpedance scale, stadiometer, calipers, a blood
                pressure monitor, glucometers, hemoglobin analyzers, a urine analyzer, a metabolic cart and a fully stocked
                phlebotomy station for blood-sample collection.

                <strong>The culinary laboratory</strong> is equipped with numerous modern kitchen stations and a demonstration station.
                The on-site audiovisual system enables filming, videoconferencing, distance education and live webcasting.
                The culinary lab provides a great learning environment for students to learn basic food theory and food preparation,
                as well as multicultural culinary techniques and skills. It has been frequently used for culinary classes
                on regional cuisine.
