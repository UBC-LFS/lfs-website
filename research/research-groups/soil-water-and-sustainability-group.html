  <h2>Facilities</h2>
  <p>The Soil and Water Sustainability Group has access to diversity of facilities and equipment across the University of British Columbia campus that enables a wide range of soil and water analysis. The group maintains a number of laboratories in the MacMillan building specifically equipped to analyze the physical and chemical properties of soil and water and greenhouse gas fluxes. There are a number of micrometeorological and greenhouse gas flux resources available in the geography department. In the Forest Sciences Centre there are a number of laboratories specializing in the analysis of soil biological components involving molecular, stable isotopes, and microscopy techniques.</p>
