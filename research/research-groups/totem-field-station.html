  Totem Field is a centrally located Research Field in the heart of Vancouver’s UBC campus. It has been used throughout the
  years for many types of research. From short term projects, to very long term projects, Totem Field is an excellent site
  for research and teaching. Our diverse soil types range from rich and Loamy to dry and desert like. We have adaptive irrigation
  capacity from drip line to overhead. We are here to lease space for all research and teaching purposes.

<h3>Our Mission</h3>

<h3>Land Usage Capacities</h3>
