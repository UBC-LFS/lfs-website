    <h3 class="intro">The Faculty of Land and Food Systems is home to a diverse set of research groups linked by a common objective: to identify
        the essential elements of sustainable food systems and to strive to develop, implement and validate solutions for
        critical problems affecting our local and global food supply chains and the people who depend on them.</h3>

    <h2>Our Areas of Strength</h2>
    <p>Our research expertise falls into three areas of core strength:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Sustainable agriculture</strong> is the production of food, plant or animal products using economically viable
            farming techniques that enhance the environment, public health, human communities, and animal welfare.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Food safety and quality</strong> are important components of a sustainable food system. High food quality leads
            to greater organoleptic and nutritional standards that will in turn result in reduced product deterioration and
            defect. Food Safety is secured by enhancing screening for food borne pathogens and chemical contaminants.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Food, nutrition and health</strong> are intrinsically connected: safe and nutritious food is a foundation for
            health and wellbeing.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Our researchers have attracted millions of dollars in research funding from sources including Natural Sciences and Engineering
        Research Council (NSERC), the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the Social Sciences and Humanities Research
        Council of Canada (SSHRC), the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), the Michael Smith Foundation Scholar Program,
        Agriculture and Agri-food Canada, BC Ministry of Agriculture, BC Investment Agriculture Foundation, and Genome Canada
        (see Research metrics above).</p>
    <p>We conduct leading edge research in areas that include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>animal biology, health, and welfare;</li>
        <li>food technology, genomics, and safety;</li>
        <li>plant, insect and soil interactions;</li>
        <li>sustainable agricultural landscapes;</li>
        <li>food security and sovereignty;</li>
        <li>community health and nutrition;</li>

    <h1>Research Chairs</h1>
    <h2>Endowed Chairs</h2>
    <p>The Faculty of Land and Food Systems currently has three Endowed Chairs and each are fully funded by endowment, which
        provides an annual generation of funds from a base of untouched capital.</p>
    <p>These Chairs support UBC’s research strategy and enhance the Faculty’s research reputation both locally and globally.</p>
    <h3>Eagles Chair in Food Biotechnology</h3>
    <p>Chair:
        <a href="">Hennie J.J. van Vuuren</a>, Professor, UBC Wine Research Centre</p>
    <p>Biotechnology is rapidly transforming the food industry through new approaches to bioprocessing, preservation, and analysis
        with consequent impact on food quality, safety and composition. The establishment of this Chair enables the Faculty
        to build on existing strengths to become a leading centre for research and teaching in the biotechnology field.</p>
    <h2>Canada Research Chairs</h2>
    <p>These federally sponsored Chairs enhance Canada’s competitiveness in the global, knowledge-based economy by helping Canadian
        universities and their affiliated research institutes become world-class centres of research and research training,
        The Faculty of Land and Food Systems currently has four Canada Research Chairs.</p>
    <h3>Canada Research Chair (Tier I) in Fish Physiology, Culture and Conservation</h3>
    <p>Chair:
        <a href="">Tony P. Farrell</a>, Professor, Zoology and Aquaculture</p>
    <p>The Chair’s research studies the mechanisms that limit or enhance the survival of fish at high temperatures or with limited
        oxygen.
    </p>
    <p>There is a growing need to farm fish for human consumption and to conserve wild fish challenged by population growth,
        environmental degradation and climate change. Confronting these problems will require new knowledge about how fish
        survive under environmental extremes. This research will advance knowledge of how fish survive under harsh conditions
        and will lead to improved fish farming and fish conservation practices.</p>
    <h3>Canada Research Chair, ‎Viticulture‬ &amp; Plant Genomics</h3>
    <p>Chair:
        <a href="">Simone Diego Castellarin</a>, Assistant Professor, Wine Research Centre</p>
    <p>This Chair studies the biological mechanisms that control how grapes ripen and how they are affected by climate. He plans
        to develop new practices for growing grapes in B.C. and Canada with the goal of producing better fruit for high quality
        and more valuable wine.</p>
    <h3>Chair:
        <a href="">Carol McAusland</a>, Associate Professor, Food and Resource Economics</h3>
    <p>The Chair’s research focuses on identifying ways in which international trade affects environmental quality.</p>
    <p>Is there a way to regulate carbon emissions without unduly hurting Canadian firms? Most lawmakers are afraid that pricing
        carbon will make Canadian firms less competitive and kill Canadian jobs. Worse, since consumers can still buy carbon-intensive
        goods from abroad, a Canadian carbon tax may have little effect on global emissions. Carol’s work on carbon footprint
        taxes shows that Canada could reduce its carbon footprint without putting domestic industries at an unfair advantage
        relative to foreign competitors. Along the way, Canada could raise enough money to reduce taxes that really do kill
        jobs—like income and payroll taxes—by $15 billion.</p>
    <h3>Canada Research Chair (Tier II) in Human Nutrition and Vitamin Metabolism</h3>
    <p>Chair:
        <a href="">Yvonne Lamers</a>, Assistant Professor, Human Nutrition</p>
    <p>The chair’s research focuses on investigating B-vitamin adequacy among Canadians and determining underlying connections
        between nutrition and disease. The research involves kinetic studies and human intervention trials to assess the
        metabolic consequences of less than optimal vitamin B-12 intake and high folic acid intake in humans.</p>
    <h2>NSERC Chairs</h2>
    <p>NSERC’s role is to make investments in people, discovery and innovation for the benefit of all Canadians by supporting
        more than 20,000 university students and postdoctoral fellows in their advanced studies, and funding more than 10,000
        university professors every year. The Faculty of Land and Food Systems currently has three NSERC Chairs.</p>
    <h3>NSERC Industrial Research Chair in Animal Welfare</h3>
    <p>This broadly focused program of research, education, and public outreach seeks practical improvements in animal welfare,
        plus knowledge-based consensus-building on contentious issues of animal use. The program, which has a strong emphasis
        on cattle, is supported by industry contributions from the Dairy Farmers of Canada (Ottawa, ON, Canada), Westgen
        Endowment Fund (Milner, BC, Canada), Pfizer Animal Health (Kirkland, QC, Canada), BC Cattle Industry Development
        Fund (Kamloops, BC, Canada), the BC Milk Producers (Burnaby, BC, Canada), BC Dairy Foundation (Burnaby, BC, Canada),
        BC Dairy Education and Research Association (Abbotsford, BC, Canada), and Alberta Milk (Edmonton, AB, Canada).</p>
    <p>The Faculty has two Senior Chairs and one Associate Chair in Animal Welfare:</p>
    <p>
        <a href="">David Fraser</a>, Ph.D., Professor, in a Senior Chair. After more than 25 years of research on the behaviour and
        welfare of farm, wild, and laboratory animals, Dr. Fraser actively continues his outreach work by serving as an animal
        welfare standard advisor to such organizations as the Royal Society of Canada (Ottawa), Canada’s National Farmed
        Animal Health and Welfare Council, the National Council of Chain Restaurants and Food Marketing Institute (Washington),
        the Burger King Corporation (Miami), and the World Organization for Animal Health (Paris).</p>
    <p>
        <a href="">Dan Weary</a>, Ph.D., Professor, in a Senior Chair. Dan’s research profile includes animal welfare, animal ethics,
        animal welfare standards, farm animals, laboratory animals, companion animals and wildlife.</p>
    <p>
        <a href="">Marina von Keyserlingk</a>, PhD., Professor in an Associate Chair. Marina (Nina) has an active research program in
        farm animals, and is recognized internationally for her work on the care of cattle. Her students are also actively
        engaged in on farm research projects that involve working closely with producers in North America interested in improving
        animal welfare of their farms. In addition to work on farm animals, Nina has contributed to the development of guidelines
        on the care and use of laboratory animals used in research, teaching and testing. She is also particularly interested
        in understanding the role of the public in ethical oversight systems used in animal research. Her outreach work includes
        serving as the Canadian Faculties of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine representative on the Canadian Council on
        Animal Care where she is currently Chair of Council, animal welfare advisor to a committee stewarded by the United
        States Department of Agriculture looking at the sustainability of the North American dairy industry and the British
        Columbia Farm Animal Care Council.</p>
