    <p>Grounded in science. Global in scope. It's how we explain a Land and Food Systems degree. Our programs use a uniquely
        integrated approach that unites scientific and interdisciplinary studies. You'll begin your studies by building a
        strong foundation in science and progress through courses that train your focus more specifically on the bigger issues
        within your chosen major, be they in food production and global markets, human nutrition, animal and soil sciences,
        or the complex interplay of resources and world regions. At every point along your learning journey, you'll have
        opportunities to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>work and develop relationships with professionals in your field of study;</li>
        <li>experience practical, hands-on learning that you can apply to real-world problems;</li>
        <li>develop your leadership competencies through on- and off-campus initiatives; and</li>
        <li>master skills that will put you out in front when it comes time to look for employment.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Land and Food Systems at UBC is a small, tight-knit faculty. Whether it's through a class, a Wednesday Night Dinner or
        a Research Cafe, you'll get to know your instructors as people and professionals, create meaningful connections with
        other students on similar paths, and meet people outside the faculty who can help you on your journey.</p>
    <p>All of our degrees are science-based. But the way we approach science is a little bit different due to our size, our
        focus on preparing you to be a professional, and our ability to integrate different communities and disciplines.
        LFS is an awesome place to do, say, your pre-med or pre-vet studies; you'll be taking the same courses, but in an
        interdisciplinary, collaborative way that's more reflective of the real world.</p>
    <p>There is no longer a single path to a given career. At LFS, the subjects, the networking, the small class sizes, the
        encouragement to study things you're deeply passionate about and the ability to learn science in ways that broaden
        your understanding of world — all of these set our programs apart. At LFS, you're not just learning. You're
        <i>contributing</i>.</p>
    <p>Science with social impact.</p>
    <p>And at the end of your LFS journey? You will be prepared to enter the working world as a knowledgeable, proactive global
        leader who is well prepared to solve some of the most pressing challenges that we're facing.</p>

    <p>New in 2018, Land One is a limited-enrolment first-year cohort option that LFS offers jointly with the Faculty of Forestry.
        Land One is a different way of experiencing your first year of university. You'll take your core first-year courses
        (math, biology, economics and communications) in a learning community cohort with instructors from different disciplines,
        diving deep into real-world issues from both Indigenous and Western perspectives. Research shows that students who
        learn in cohorts tend to do better in the later years of their degree. You should
        <a href="http://landone.ubc.ca/">check it out</a>. Keep in mind: there are application deadlines, and entry is competitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="row-fluid border-bottom">
    <h2>Outside the Classroom</h2>
    <p>Your core LFS courses will develop your employment readiness by virtue of their interdisciplinary and collaborative nature.
        But you can take it way further by getting involved in things that carry you beyond the scope of your degree. UBC
        has queued up hundreds of incredible experiences that'll grow you as a scholar and a changemaker.</p>
