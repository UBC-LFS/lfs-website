    <h3 class="intro">If you want your education to have big impact, start here. The Faculty of Land and Food Systems at UBC is where you'll
        uncover your interests and get connected with the global issues that matter most to you. Think of it as an applied
        exploratory degree. In an LFS degree, you'll work with faculty, professional practitioners, community leaders and
        peers to drive change in the areas of food security and safety, human nutrition, and the way we lean on our land.
        You'll build a science foundation that's worthy of pre-med, expand your specialized skills in the systems you choose
        to study, and round it all out with deep development of your job-ready competencies.</h3>

        <p>We're not your everyday science faculty. Our small size and intimate groupings — like our Land One cohort — mean you'll
            get to know your profs and peers better. You'll study across a broader range than just in your own field, and learn
            to look for solutions in novel ways (hint: that's a BIG plus for employability). For example, you know how establishing
            a wind farm would involve engineering, geography, economics, IT, design, construction and maintenance? Well, land
            and food systems work the same way: the problems here require thinking and collaboration among many different
            minds. At LFS, we understand that, and we look for ways to bring disciplines together as much as we can. Working
            with other people to address problems sharpens your competencies in curiosity, innovation and collaboration — all
            very valuable tools in a fast-changing world.</p>
        <p>Through your degree program, you'll establish connections with people in your own and other fields, which will strengthen
            your personal and professional networks — another arrow in your career quiver. LFS offers you tons of career
            development opportunities as you progress through your studies. Both in and out of the classroom, we're putting you
            in line with experiences that will set you up for career success. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>when you do a study exchange, you're not just learning content in a different location, you're building adaptability,
                communication and cultural competency skills that transfer to the working world;</li>
            <li>as you participate in a field study, you're applying knowledge in a hands-on way that adds to your work experience
                and value to employers;</li>
            <li>when you're working with a community group to solve a problem, you're developing the collaboration and communication
                skills that organizations so desperately need; and</li>
            <li>completing a co-op term situates you in the professional arena, builds your on-the-ground skills and connects you with
                people who can move your career along. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>So engage with these different kinds of learning experiences as often as you can! You're in the driver's seat, and your
            LFS degree will be what you make it. Use it as an opportunity to develop yourself and your capabilities as much as
            possible.

    <p>Grounded in science. Global in scope. It's how we explain a Land and Food Systems degree. Our programs use a uniquely
        integrated approach that unites scientific and interdisciplinary studies. You'll begin your studies by building a
        strong foundation in science, and progress through courses that train your focus more specifically on the bigger issues
        within your chosen major, be they in food production and global markets, human nutrition, animal and soil sciences,
        or the complex interplay between resources and world regions.</p>

    <p>Land and Food Systems at UBC is a small, tight-knit faculty. Whether it's through a class, a Wednesday Night Dinner or
        a Research Cafe, you'll get to know your instructors as people and professionals, create meaningful connections with
        other students on similar paths and meet people outside the faculty who can help you on your journey.</p>
    <p>All of our degrees are science-based. But the way we approach science is a little bit different due to our size, our
        focus on preparing you to be a professional, and our ability to integrate different communities and disciplines.
        LFS is an awesome place to do your pre-med or pre-vet studies, for example; you'll be taking the same courses, but in an
        interdisciplinary, collaborative way that's more reflective of the real world.</p>
    <p>There is no longer a single path to a given career. At LFS, the subjects, the networking, the small class sizes, the
        encouragement to study things you're deeply passionate about and the ability to learn science in ways that broaden
        your understanding of world — all of these set our programs apart. At LFS, you're not just learning. You're
        <i>contributing</i>.</p>
    <p>Science with social impact.</p>

    <p>Land One is a limited-enrolment first-year cohort option that LFS offers jointly with the Faculty of Forestry.
        Land One is a different way of experiencing your first year of university. You'll take your core first-year courses
        (math, biology, economics and communications) in a small learning community with instructors from different disciplines,
        diving deep into real-world issues from both Indigenous and Western perspectives. Research shows that students who
        learn in cohorts tend to do better in the later years of their degree. You should
        <a href="http://landone.ubc.ca/">check it out</a>. Keep in mind: there are application deadlines, and entry is competitive.</p>

<div class="row-fluid border-bottom" id="leverage">
    <h2>Leverage Your Learning</h2>
    <p>Your core LFS courses will develop your employment readiness by virtue of their interdisciplinary and collaborative nature.
        But you can take it way further by getting involved in things that carry you beyond the scope of your degree. UBC
        has queued up hundreds of incredible experiences that'll grow you as a scholar . . . and as a changemaker.</p>
