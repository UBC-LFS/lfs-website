            <p><strong>We are a Faculty of superheroes.</strong><br>
            <p class="dean-message">If you think about it, the goal of any good superhero is to save the world – which is exactly what our faculty members, staff and students set out to do every day by addressing global issues surrounding health and sustainable land and food systems.</p>        
            <p class="dean-message">And there is much that needs to be saved. All living things depend on the sustainability of the earth’s resources, and learning how to protect and better manage those limited resources is crucial to our survival. Critical environmental issues like water pollution, food shortages and rising temperatures could have a catastrophic effect on our ability to meet basic human needs in the near future.</p>
            <p class="dean-message">Here’s the good news: experts in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems are working on solutions to many of these problems. Our researchers are studying everything from climate change and storm water management to the relationship between food, nutrition, diet and health. The research discoveries being made here have the potential to reach across borders for world-wide applications.</p>
            <p class="dean-message">We’re also sharing what we’ve learned with the next generation of scientists – our students.  They come to us with a strong sense of global responsibility, passionate about creating positive and lasting change. We believe that by providing them with the opportunity to learn outside the traditional classroom – whether it’s through an internship in their chosen field, taking part in a community-based experiential learning project or studying overseas – we can enhance their education and help them develop the skills they need to make their mark. </p>
            <p class="dean-message">I can personally attest to the quality of education that our students receive, having once been a student here myself. To be able to return as Dean is particularly rewarding for me and I’m looking forward to working together and helping to shape the future of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems.</p>
