    <h2 id="trigger-animation">Our Vision</h2>
    <h3 class="intro">
        The Faculty of Land and Food Systems is a world leader in integrated research, education and service to address critical
        global issues around human health and a sustainable food supply.
    </h3>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <h3 class="intro">
        The UBC Faculty of Land and Food Systems uses student-centered learning to educate new generations of scientists equipped
        to solve the most fundamental issues faced by society — those focused around human health, a sustainable food supply
        and the responsible use of finite land and water resources. To that end, Faculty initiatives foster and support
        research excellence, innovative active learning environments, strong community connections, and global and local
        collaborations.
    </h3>
    <h2>What We Do Differently</h2>
    <h3 class="intro">Experts in our faculty — including our students — are developing workable solutions that address global issues in the
        areas of health, sustainable food systems and managing our limited resources. We learn together, ask questions of
        each other, innovate, iterate and collaborate across disciplines and industries to solve problems. Through co-op
        work terms, field experiences, community projects and international study, our students develop a rich complement
        of skills and competencies that not only gives them a competitive advantage upon graduation, but that pushes them farther
        down the road to creating lasting change.
    </h3>
    <h3 class="intro">The world needs saving. We create the thinkers who go out and do it.</h3>

                <p>
                    <strong>We are a Faculty of superheroes.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you think about it, the goal of any good superhero is to save the world — which is exactly what our faculty members, staff
                    and students set out to do every day by addressing global issues surrounding health and sustainable land
                    and food systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And there is much that needs to be saved. All living things depend on the sustainability of the Earth’s resources, and learning
                    how to protect and better manage those limited resources is crucial to our survival. Critical environmental
                    issues like water pollution, food shortages and rising temperatures could have a catastrophic effect
                    on our ability to meet basic human needs in the near future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here’s the good news: experts in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems are working on solutions to many of these problems.
                    Our researchers are studying everything from climate change and storm water management to the relationship
                    between food, nutrition, diet and health. The research discoveries being made here reach across borders
                    and offer worldwide applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We’re also sharing what we’ve learned with the next generation of scientists — our students. They come to us with a strong
                    sense of global responsibility, passionate about creating positive and lasting change. We believe that
                    by providing them with the opportunity to learn outside the traditional classroom — whether it’s through
                    an internship in their chosen field, taking part in a community-based experiential learning project or
                    studying overseas — we can enhance their education and help them develop the skills they need to make
                    their mark.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can personally attest to the quality of education that our students receive, having once been a student here myself. To
                    be able to return as Dean is particularly rewarding for me. I’m looking forward to working together and
                    helping to shape the future of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems.
