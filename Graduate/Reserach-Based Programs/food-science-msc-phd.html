    [tabs] [tab title="Why Pursue Graduate Studies in Food Science at UBC?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>UBC's innovative research in Food Science has brought national and international recognition to our faculty and student researchers, attracting not just awards but also valuable collaborations with research centres and universities across Canada and around the world. Since its inception in 1969, the Food Science program at UBC has been a leader in providing opportunities for advanced study and research in food chemistry and biochemistry, process science, microbiology, safety and toxicology, biotechnology, quality evaluation and wine biotechnology.</p>
        <p>Our faculty takes an interdisciplinary, community-connected and hands-on approach to Food Science education and research to address issues around food, nutrition and health, and the responsible use of finite land and water resources. Underlining it all is the drive to ensure a sustainable and safe food supply — for us, and for everyone.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The Food Science program offers opportunities for advanced study and research leading to MSc and PhD degrees in the areas of: food chemistry and biochemistry; food process science; food microbiology; food safety and toxicology; food biotechnology; food quality evaluation; and wine biotechnology.</p>
      <p>Graduate training in Food Science normally involves a combination of courses in both basic and applied sciences, with research leading to a thesis. Students are encouraged to publish their research results in refereed journals.</p>
      <p>Coursework is selected in consultation with the student’s supervisory committee and includes graduate courses in food science, and from other disciplines relevant to each student’s research area.</p>
      <p>In addition to laboratories equipped for chemical, analytical, molecular biology and microbiological (including Biosafety level 2) based research on food, the program houses pilot plant and sensory evaluation facilities for research requiring food-grade specifications.</p>
      <p>Students can also access research facilities at UBC, such as the Laboratory of Molecular Biophysics, BioImaging Facility and Michael Smith Laboratories, as well as through collaborations with other institutions including Agriculture & Agri-Food Canada and the Department of Fisheries & Oceans.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In addition, applicants to the graduate programs in Food Science are expected to have completed prerequisite fundamental undergraduate courses in organic chemistry, biochemistry, calculus, physics, statistics and microbiology. Applicants who lack some of these prerequisites and/or who do not have previous undergraduate background courses in the field of food science (food process science; food chemistry; food analysis; food laws, regulations &amp; quality assurance; microorganisms in food systems; and principles in food engineering) may be required to take additional coursework for their program.</p>
      <p>Specifically, students must have completed, as pre- or corequisites, the equivalent of four courses (12 credits) from the following six core courses in Food Science:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>FNH 309 Food Process Science</p>
        </li>
        <li>

          <p>FNH 300 Principles in Food Engineering</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Please note that the program receives many applications meeting the minimum program admission requirements. Admission is recommended for a select number of candidates who demonstrate outstanding academic standing and research potential or background, and who have a confirmed research supervisor.</p>
      <p><strong>For students who wish to be considered for scholarships</strong>, preference is given to those who submit a complete application (including all required supporting documentation to enable to full file review and evaluation) to Graduate Studies before <strong>January 31</strong>.

      <h2>MSc program</h2>
      <p>Students admitted to the MSc degree program will possess a BSc degree in Food Science or a related area, and must meet the general requirements for master's degree programs set by the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies.</p>
      <h2>PhD program</h2>
      <p>Students admitted to the PhD degree program will normally possess a MSc degree in Food Science or a related area, with clear evidence of research ability or potential. Transfer from the MSc to the PhD program is permitted under regulations set forth by the Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Degree Requirements"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <h2>Master of Science</h2>
        <p>The MSc program requirements are as follows:</p>
        <p>Completion of the MSc program requires a thesis (12 or 18 credits) plus coursework, for a total of 30 credits. With a 12-credit thesis, students can include a maximum of 6 credits of senior undergraduate courses. With an 18-credit thesis, students can include a maximum of 3 credits of senior undergraduate courses.</p>
        <p>Students who are planning a professional career will typically enrol in the 12-credit thesis option. The 18-credit value option requires a more intensive research experience and is more appropriate for students considering the PhD program or a research career. The thesis credit decision should be determined in consultation with the student and research advisor at the start of the program.</p>
        <p>Additional coursework may be recommended upon consultation with the student's supervisory committee.</p>
        <h2>PhD</h2>
        <p>The PhD program requirements are as follows:</p>
