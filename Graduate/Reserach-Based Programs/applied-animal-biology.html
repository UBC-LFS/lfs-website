                <h3> Why study Applied Animal Biology?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>Applied Animal Biology is intended for students who want to study and/or work with animals. It provides students with fundamentals of animal behaviour, animal physiology and related fields as applied to farm, companion and other animals. It also exposes students to the role of animals in human society and the ethical, environmental and other issues that arise. It offers training in research skills needed for graduate work, and (with appropriate selection of courses) prepares students for admission to veterinary and human medicine. Students have various options to gain practical experience on farms and in laboratories, animal shelters and wildlife rehabilitation centres.</p>

                <p>Applied Animal Biology is intended for students with a strong interest in animals and wanting to pursue careers working with animals (e.g., veterinary medicine). This major will provide students with fundamentals in the field of animal science and will provide considerable flexibility to students when selecting courses that meet their specific interests. Students are exposed to a challenging capstone research experience in the third and fourth years of the program.Admission to the Applied Animal Biology Major is to second year (with an option of third-year admission). Admission is based on a minimum academic standing of 70%, calculated as a cumulative average of grades from all prerequisite and program courses taken. Elective courses are not included in this calculation. Note that due to program demand, the academic standard required for admission may be higher than the published minimum.</p>

        [tab title="Honours Program"] 
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The Applied Animal Biology Honours program is intended for exceptional students with an interest in research. Students interested in careers in research-intensive areas including veterinary medicine, biomedical science, animal welfare, animal reproduction, and wildlife conservation may especially benefit from this opportunity.</p>
                <h2>Admission</h2>
                <p>This program will only accept students with both a strong academic record during their first and second years of study and an interest in research.</p>
                <p>Successful applicants will have a cumulative average greater than 75%.</p>
                <h2>Application</h2>
                <p>The applicant must write a letter explaining why they wish to enrol, their career goals, and any past or current research experience they may have. The applicant's request and Letter of Intent must be submitted to LFS Student Services by March 31 of their second year of study.</p>
                <p>Successful applicants admitted into the Honours Program must complete a minimum of <strong>132 credits</strong> rather than the 123 credits required to graduate with an Applied Animal Biology degree. Of these 132 credits, <strong>48 must be chosen from the Applied Animal Biology Restricted Electives list</strong>. Students must complete their degree within <strong>a maximum of 5 calendar years</strong>. During the third and fourth years, Honours students must not fail any attempted courses, must complete a minimum of 30 credits per calendar year, and maintain a minimum of 70% in every 300- and 400-level course completed. Students who do not meet these requirements will move to the Applied Animal Biology Major and will no longer be eligible to stay in the Honours program.</p>
                <h2>Required Courses</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>APBI 398 (3 credits) - Research Methods in Applied Animal Biology</p></li>
