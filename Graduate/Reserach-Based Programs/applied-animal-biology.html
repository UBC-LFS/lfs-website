                <h3> Why study Applied Animal Biology?</h3>
                <p>UBC's Applied Animal Biology program is flexible and practical, and provides you with hands-on experiences that prepare you for a career after graduation. Our instructors are passionate about what they do, and come from a variety of backgrounds, which means you'll be learning with professionals who are outstanding in their fields. It also means you'll get a broader awareness of career paths and opportunities to work with animals beyond the careers you've already heard of.</p>

        [tab title="Program Overview"] 
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>If you want to study and/or work with animals, UBC's Applied Animal Biology program is ideal for you. This program gives you a broad background in the fundamentals of animal behaviour, animal physiology and related fields as they apply to farm, companion and other animals. You'll learn about the role of animals in human society, and examine the ethical, environmental and other issues that arise from our connection with them. This degree program offers training in the research skills you'll need for graduate work, and — with the appropriate selection of courses — it can even prepare you for admission to veterinary and human medicine. Throughout your degree, you will be offered a variety of opportunities to gain practical experience on farms, as well as in laboratories, animal shelters and wildlife rehabilitation centres. In Applied Animal Biology, you'll grapple with real-world biological issues, problems and challenges, and you'll study — and possibly even devise — real-world solutions to them. This experiential learning gives you transferable skills to take with you into the workforce, or into further studies at grad school.</p>
                <p>In completing your Applied Animal Biology degree, you will take a combination of degree requirements (required of all students) and restricted electives (courses selected from a curated list of approved electives). You'll be able to round it all out with some unrestricted electives (courses you get to pick yourself).</p>

                <h3>Honours</h3>
                <p>Are you an exceptional achiever? Do you have a strong interest in research? Then the Applied Animal Biology Honours program just might be the perfect fit. If you're interested in a research-intensive career, including areas in veterinary medicine, biomedical science, animal welfare, animal reproduction and wildlife conservation, you may especially benefit from this opportunity. Admission to the Honours program is competitive. To learn more about this option, please consult the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,897,1446">UBC Academic Calendar</a>.</p>
                <h3>Minors</h3>
                <p>You may choose to supplement your Applied Animal Biology major with a minor program, which involves taking courses in a subject area outside of your specialization. As an APBI student, you're eligible to apply for a <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,909,0#24933">Minor in Arts</a>, a <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,909,0#20393">Minor in Commerce</a> or a <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,909,0#20394">Minor in Science</a>.
