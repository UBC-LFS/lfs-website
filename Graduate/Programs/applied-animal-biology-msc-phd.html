    <h3>You're ready to take your work and research with animals to the next level. UBC's graduate programs in Applied Animal Biology will get you there. This is where your learning will contribute to the growing body of knowledge in the areas of animal physiology, behaviour, welfare, and management of livestock, aquaculture, and wildlife species. It's work the world needs. And this is the place to start.</h3>

    [tabs] [tab title="Why Pursue Graduate Studies in Applied Animal Biology at UBC?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>UBC is uniquely equipped to offer you a rich and well-rounded graduate degree in Applied Animal Biology. After all, we've been honing our expertise for over a century: The Faculty of Agriculture (now LFS) was one of UBC's three founding faculties back in 1915, with Animal Husbandry as one of Agriculture's first four programs. Still today, our MSc and PhD programs benefit from state-of-the-art on-campus teaching and research facilities, as well as off-campus research facilities like: the UBC Dairy Education and Research Centre in Agassiz; shared research facilities at Fisheries and Oceans Canada at West Vancouver; and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. These collaboration-rich graduate programs connect you with colleagues in other UBC graduate programs such as Zoology, and with experts working with agencies such as Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada, Canadian Wildlife Service and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>

    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The Applied Animal Biology program (formerly Animal Science) offers opportunities for advanced study and research on animals under human care.</p>
        <p>Students interested in improving the lives of animals have the opportunity to complete a MSc or PhD through the UBC Animal Welfare Program.</p>
        <p>Students interested in applied and basic aspects of cattle reproduction and the interrelations between health, behaviour and nutrition are welcome to apply for the MSc and/or PhD in Applied Animal Biology (Animal Reproduction Laboratory).</p>
        <p>The UBC Animal Welfare Program is one of the largest and most respected programs in the world in the field of animal welfare science. Since its inception in 1997, the program’s research has led to improvements in the lives of animals in British Columbia and around the world. The mission of the program is to improve the welfare and humane care of animals in agriculture, research, companionship and other areas through active efforts in research, education and public outreach. For additional information view the <a href="http://awp.landfood.ubc.ca/">UBC Animal Welfare website</a>.</p>
        <p>Graduate training in applied animal biology normally involves a combination of courses in both basic and applied sciences, with research leading to a thesis or dissertation. Students are expected to publish their research results in relevant leading international refereed journals. Coursework selected in consultation with the student's supervisory committee includes graduate courses in areas relevant to each student's research.</p>

    [/tab] [tab title="Degree Requirements"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <h2>Master of Science</h2>
        <p>The MSc program requirements are as follows:</p>
        <p>Completion of the MSc program requires a thesis (12 or 18 credits) plus coursework, for a total of 30 credits. With a 12-credit thesis, students can include a maximum of 6 credits of senior undergraduate courses. With an 18-credit thesis, students can include a maximum of 3 credits of senior undergraduate courses.</p>
        <p>Students who are planning a professional career will typically enrol in the 12-credit thesis option. The 18-credit value option requires a more intensive research experience and is more appropriate for students considering the PhD program or a research career. The thesis credit decision should be determined in consultation with the student and research advisor at the start of the program.</p>
        <p>Additional coursework may be recommended upon consultation with the student's supervisory committee.</p>
        <h2>PhD</h2>
        <p>The PhD program requirements are as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>coursework will be selected in consultation with the student's supervisory committee</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>students are required to take a comprehensive examination</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>completion of a research thesis demonstrating ability to conduct significant and original scientific research</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Coursework</h2>
        <p>Coursework is selected in consultation with the student's supervisory committee, and includes graduate courses in animal science and from other areas relevant to each students research.</p>
