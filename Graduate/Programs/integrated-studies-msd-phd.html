    <h3>You're leveling up, taking your food systems studies to new heights. UBC's master's and doctoral degree programs in Integrated Studies in Land and Food Systems (ISLFS) acknowledge the fact that food isn't grown, packaged, consumed, disposed of — or understood — in one single way. That's why our program integrates knowledge and expertise across disciplines and industries. UBC's ISLFS graduate programs push you to learn more, to contribute to the global body of knowledge in land and food systems, and to develop sustainable solutions for a more whole and healthy world.</h3>

    <h2> What you need to know </h2>
    [tabs] [tab title="Why Pursue Graduate Studies in Applied Animal Biology at UBC?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>The objective of the Integrated Studies in Land and Food Systems graduate program is to help you develop the knowledge base and integrative skills necessary to evaluate the cycle of food systems, production, processing and disposal. Your work here will contribute to the global push to develop sustainable solutions based on agroecological, economic and social dimensions.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Arguably the most important challenge for the world community in the 21st century is global food security: our ability to create a sufficient, healthy, safe, culturally relevant and economically accessible food system for everyone. Sustainable food systems will require more than technological advances, and must integrate economic, social and environmental relationships, thus involving community, land and food systems.</p>
        <p>New solutions will demand that researchers and policy makers approach the task differently from in the past. We can no longer expect solutions to come from a single discipline. The Integrated Studies in Land and Food Systems graduate program offers you the opportunity to focus on such key complex issues. It encourages you to use holistic approaches that integrate knowledge from across disciplines to find solutions relevant to diverse communities.</p>
        <p>The Integrated Studies in Land and Food Systems program (ISLFS) is for graduate students wishing to work within emerging interdisciplinary fields.</p>

    [/tab] [tab title="Admissions"]
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Admission is in accordance with requirements set by <a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/application-admission/admission-requirements">UBC’s Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies</a>. Application to the ISLFS is not restricted to students with a degree in one of the disciplines in agricultural sciences or agroecology. Successful applicants can come from any recognized university degree program, and this diversity is reflected in the current graduate students enrolled in the program.</p>
      <p>Prospective students should consult the general LFS Graduate Admissions page for more information.</p>
      <p>Application deadlines for MSc/PhD applicants:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>For May 2017 start date, the deadline is September 2016.</li>
        <li>For September 2017 start date, the deadline is January 2017.</li>
        <li>For January 2018 start date, the deadline is June 2017.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In order to receive full funding consideration, applicants must have all documents submitted by January 30.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Degree Requirements"]
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Master's students will complete and present their research proposal along with most of their courses within the first year of their program. Normally they will be expected to defend their dissertation at the end of their second year. Doctoral students will usually complete coursework and their candidacy exam within two years, and the defence of their doctoral dissertation in their third or fourth years.</p>
      <p>The minimum course requirements for master's degrees are 30 credits, of which at least 18 must be numbered 500 and above. A maximum of 6 credits at the undergraduate level in courses numbered 300 to 499 may be counted toward the requirements of a master’s degree. The MSc research thesis (LFS 549) is 12 credits.</p>
      <p>Coursework, selected in consultation with the student’s supervisory committee, includes graduate courses in Land and Food Systems and from other areas relevant to each student’s research. Please consult the UBC Calendar for course timetable details.</p>
