  <h3>The Soil, Water and Sustainability Research Group is a collective of collaborating academics, students and professionals whose research addresses the basic scientific information required for food production, forest products and maintaining the integrity of ecological systems for sustaining the resource base. The focus is on the physical and biological environment and the integrated relationship between land and water systems. An emphasis is placed on improving professional and technical communications to stakeholders in these areas.</h3>
  <i>The Soil, Water and Air Laboratory (SWAL) group has been updated and restructured to form the Soil, Water and Sustainability Group.</i>

      <a href="">Kevin Allen</a>
      <p>I am interested in studying the fundamental reasons why foodborne pathogens continue to be a significant issue in our food chain. I am interested in how stress response physiology is affected by food chain-relevant stress events and in antimicrobial resistance of zoonotic foodborne pathogens.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <a href="">John Frostad</a>
      <p>My group develops and employs new experimental techniques for quantifying the effects of interfacial phenomena in multiphase liquids including foams and emulsions. One target of this research is improving formulation of food products and developing new functional foods.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <a href="">David Kitts</a>
      <p>My research discipline is Food Chemistry and Toxicology, with a particular focus on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of both nutrient and food toxicant action in living organisms. I also examine the mechanisms of antioxidant and prooxidant activity for naturally occurring animal and plant constituents.</p>  
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <a href="">Xiaonan Lu</a>
      <p>I work on developing innovative and rapid sensing, instrumentation systems and detection methods for ensuring food safety and preventing food bioterrorism. Novel biophotonic, nano-biosensing and nano-optical imaging techniques are applied to systems related to food chemical and microbiological safety.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <a href="">Vivien Measday</a>
      <p>My current research is the study of chromosome segregation in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) using molecular biology and genomic tools.  I am interested in understanding how chromosomes attach to spindle microtubules and segregate equally in mitosis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <a href="">Anubhav Pratap Singh</a>
      <p>My current research focuses on examining the impact of novel food processing technologies on food safety and quality. I am also developing novel extraction technologies for in-situ extraction and decontamination of bioactives, functional ingredients and nutraceuticals from plant components.</p>
    </div>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <a href="">Christine Scaman</a>
      <p>I am interested in enzymes that can be effective therapeutic agents to treat disease states (e.g., alpha-Glucosidase I) and enzymes that have considerable industrial potential (e.g., Tyrosine/Phenylalanine Ammonia Lyase). I am also interested in Tinamou egg proteins and microfluidics in food analysis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <a href="">Hennie van Vuuren</a>
      <p>Dr. van Vuuren (Blythe and Violet Eagles Chair in Food Biotechnology) is a wine biotechnologist . The first two genetically engineered wine yeasts to receive Generally Regarded As Safe (GRAS) status from the US FDA were constructed in his laboratory.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="span4">
      <a href="">Siyun Wang</a>
      <p>I am interested in the virulence factors, stress response, and pathogenesis of microorganisms that post major threats to food safety and public health. I use molecular biology and genomic approaches to develop novel, rapid and reliable detection methods for foodborne pathogens.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span4">
      <a href="">Rickey Y. Yada</a>
      <p>I am interested in the structure-function relationships of food and non-food related enzymes using molecular biology and various physico-chemical techniques, carbohydrate metabolism in potatoes as related to process quality, and applications of food-related nanoscale science and technology.</p>
