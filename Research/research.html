    <h1>Research Chairs</h1>
    <h2>Endowed Chairs</h2>
    <p>The Faculty of Land and Food Systems currently has three Endowed Chairs and each are fully funded by endowment, which
        provides an annual generation of funds from a base of untouched capital.</p>
    <p>These Chairs support UBC’s research strategy and enhance the Faculty’s research reputation both locally and globally.</p>
    <h3>Eagles Chair in Food Biotechnology</h3>
    <p>Chair:
        <a href="">Hennie J.J. van Vuuren</a>, Professor, UBC Wine Research Centre</p>
    <p>Biotechnology is rapidly transforming the food industry through new approaches to bioprocessing, preservation, and analysis
        with consequent impact on food quality, safety and composition. The establishment of this Chair enables the Faculty
        to build on existing strengths to become a leading centre for research and teaching in the biotechnology field.</p>
    <h2>Canada Research Chairs</h2>
    <p>These federally sponsored Chairs enhance Canada’s competitiveness in the global, knowledge-based economy by helping Canadian
        universities and their affiliated research institutes become world-class centres of research and research training,
        The Faculty of Land and Food Systems currently has four Canada Research Chairs.</p>
    <h3>Canada Research Chair (Tier I) in Fish Physiology, Culture and Conservation</h3>
    <p>Chair:
        <a href="">Tony P. Farrell</a>, Professor, Zoology and Aquaculture</p>
    <p>The Chair’s research studies the mechanisms that limit or enhance the survival of fish at high temperatures or with limited
        oxygen.</p>
    <p>There is a growing need to farm fish for human consumption and to conserve wild fish challenged by population growth,
        environmental degradation and climate change. Confronting these problems will require new knowledge about how fish
        survive under environmental extremes. This research will advance knowledge of how fish survive under harsh conditions
        and will lead to improved fish farming and fish conservation practices.</p>
    <h3>Canada Research Chair, ‎Viticulture‬ &amp; Plant Genomics</h3>
    <p>Chair:
        <a href="">Simone Diego Castellarin</a>, Assistant Professor, Wine Research Centre</p>
    <p>This Chair studies the biological mechanisms that control how grapes ripen and how they are affected by climate. He plans
        to develop new practices for growing grapes in B.C. and Canada with the goal of producing better fruit for high quality
        and more valuable wine.</p>
    <h3>Chair:
        <a href="">Carol McAusland</a>, Associate Professor, Food and Resource Economics</h3>
    <p>The Chair’s research focuses on identifying ways in which international trade affects environmental quality.</p>
    <p>Is there a way to regulate carbon emissions without unduly hurting Canadian firms? Most lawmakers are afraid that pricing
        carbon will make Canadian firms less competitive and kill Canadian jobs. Worse, since consumers can still buy carbon-intensive
        goods from abroad, a Canadian carbon tax may have little effect on global emissions. Carol’s work on carbon footprint
        taxes shows that Canada could reduce its carbon footprint without putting domestic industries at an unfair advantage
        relative to foreign competitors. Along the way, Canada could raise enough money to reduce taxes that really do kill
        jobs—like income and payroll taxes—by $15 billion.</p>
    <h3>Canada Research Chair (Tier II) in Human Nutrition and Vitamin Metabolism</h3>
    <p>Chair:
        <a href="">Yvonne Lamers</a>, Assistant Professor, Human Nutrition</p>
    <p>The chair’s research focuses on investigating B-vitamin adequacy among Canadians and determining underlying connections
        between nutrition and disease. The research involves kinetic studies and human intervention trials to assess the
        metabolic consequences of less than optimal vitamin B-12 intake and high folic acid intake in humans.</p>
