<p>
	Financial support for graduate students within LFS typically comes from one or more of four basic sources:  merit-based awards administered by the Faculty of Graduate &amp; Postdoctoral Studies (including Affiliated Fellowships and LFS Departmental Awards), teaching and research assistantships, need-based awards and direct awards from external agencies such as the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), the National Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC).
</p>
<p>
	Effective January 1, 2016, all newly admitted graduate students in research-based MSc and PhD program will be supported by a minimum funding package at $16,000/year for 2 years for M.Sc. students and $16,000/year for 4 years for Ph.D. students provided they maintain good academic standing.
</p>
<p>
	In May 2017 the UBC-V Senate approved the establishment of a university-wide minimum funding level for all PhD students. Specifically, all full-time students who begin a UBC-Vancouver PhD program in September 2018 or later will be provided with a minimum funding package equal to $18,000 for each of the first four years of their PhD.
</p>
<p>
	The funding package may consist of internal or external award, scholarship, teaching or research assistantship, or any combination of the above.  Master’s students will be supported for a period of 2 years and PhD doctoral students will receive 4 years of support. Students are expected to be proactive in applying for awards and scholarships.

</p>

<p>
	Bursaries are non-repayable awards that are given to students on the basis of financial need. At UBC, there are the following two bursary programs available: General Bursaries: UBC’s General Bursary program is designed to help fill your “unmet need,” which is the gap between your educational costs and your available government assistance. This program covers most bursaries available to UBC students, although it is separate from the Major Entrance Awards. If you’re entering UBC directly from secondary school, you should consider applying for both the bursary program and the Major Entrance Awards. Affiliation Bursaries: There are many different Affiliation Bursaries. Eligibility for these bursaries is usually determined by connection to a specific club, trade union, company, geographic region, or demographic group. The requirements for each bursary are unique. Each bursary has its own eligibility requirements. In addition, there is an application process (including deadlines) for all UBC bursaries. Bursary application are not administered through the LFS Grad Office nor are we ever informed of or publicize recipient information due to the confidential nature of bursaries.
