<p>
  UBC has introduced a new online application system for prospective graduate students applying for programs with start dates
  in January 2016 or later. This new technology offers applicants a clear and intuitive path through the application process
  and greater flexibility for applicants and referees to provide required information and documentation. The new application
  system is available for applicants for Master’s or Doctoral programs with September 2018 start date, and can be accessed
  here at
  <a href="http://apply.grad.ubc.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply.grad.ubc.ca</a>
</p>

<p>
  The M.Sc. and Doctoral programs require a supervisor and a detailed funding plan in order to be admitted. Before submitting
  the on-line application, get in contact with potential supervisors in the program of your interest and check their availability
  to accept you. [accordions collapsible=true active=false] [accordion title="Graduate Application Procedure Package"] Your complete application must include the following documents:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Application</strong>: Available online through the <a href="http://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/application-admission/apply-online">Faculty of Graduate Studies website</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Application Fee</strong>: <a href="https://secure.grad.ubc.ca/AccountC/instructions.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Online via the application system</a>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Report on Applicant</strong>: A minimum of <strong>three</strong> references are required for application to graduate programs at UBC. References should be requested from individuals who are prepared to provide a report on your academic ability and qualifications ( <a href="http://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/application-admission/letters-reference"
   target="_blank" rel="noopener">available online</a>) There are three possible formats for references: <strong>Electronic references</strong>: many graduate programs utilize an electronic reference ("e-ref") system. In the online application system, applicants are asked to provide an email address for each referee. (Please note, that we are unable to accept e-mails from Hotmail, Yahoo, GMail, MSN or other free e-mail accounts for referees.) A unique link will be emailed to each referee, allowing them to log in to a secure site and submit an online reference or upload a reference document as an attachment. <strong>Paper letters of reference: </strong>your referee may wish to send a paper letter<strong>. </strong>Paper letters of reference should be on referee's official letterhead and must be mailed directly to the relevant program in a sealed and endorsed envelope. <strong>Paper reference forms:</strong> UBC provides an <a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/forms/reference-letter-report-applicant-admission-graduate-studies"> academic reference form</a> and a <a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/forms/reference-letter-report-applicant-admission-graduate-studies">professional reference form</a>.
    <ul>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/forms/reference-letter-report-applicant-admission-graduate-studies">academic reference form</a> is used in situations where the referee is someone who you have interacted with in an academic setting (e.g. referee was the professor of a course in which you were enrolled).</li>
      <li>The <a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/forms/reference-letter-report-applicant-admission-graduate-studies">professional reference form</a> is used in situations where the reference is someone who you have interacted with in a professional setting (e.g. referee was your supervisor at work).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your referee will fill out the applicable reference form and either upload into the application system, or mail it directly
      to the relevant program in a sealed and endorsed envelope.</li>

    <strong>UBC changed its application document requirements.</strong>
    <p>
      If you are applying to begin study in 2016 or beyond, you will normally scan and upload digital copies (.pdfs) of official
      required documents in the application system. These are considered "unofficial documents". The uploaded copies of your
      official documents will be used for initial evaluation of the applicant. Conditional admission offers may be made based
      on documents uploaded to the application system. <strong>However, admission offers will not be finalized and applicants will not be allowed to register in a graduate program until all required official academic records are received and validated by the University.</strong>
    </p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Document Translations</strong>: Where academic records are produced in a language other than English, the applicant must
    arrange for the submission of the official literal translations of all records along with the transcripts.</li>
  <li>
    <strong>Degree Certificates</strong>: In cases where the transcript does not clearly state that a degree has been conferred,
    a degree certificate is required to accompany the academic record.</li>
  <li>
    <p>
      <strong>English Language Proficiency (TOEFL or IELTS)</strong>: Applicants from a university outside Canada in which English
      is not the primary language of instruction must provide results of an English language proficiency examination as part
      of their application. Tests must have been taken within the last 24 months at the time of submission of your application.
