  <h3 class="intro">You're leveling up, taking your food systems studies to new heights. UBC's master's and doctoral degree
    programs in Integrated Studies in Land and Food Systems (ISLFS) acknowledge the fact that food isn't grown, packaged,
    consumed, disposed of — or understood — in one single way. That's why our program integrates knowledge and expertise
    across disciplines and industries. UBC's ISLFS graduate programs push you to learn more, to contribute to the global
    body of knowledge in land and food systems, and to develop sustainable solutions for a more whole and healthy world.</h3>

  <h2>What you need to know</h2>
  [tabs] [tab title="Why Pursue Graduate Studies in ISLFS at UBC?"]
  <div class="paragraph">

    The Integrated Studies in Land and Food Systems programs provide opportunities for students to broaden their knowledge base
    and gain more advanced research experiences. ISLFS students work on diverse and often interdisciplinary research areas
    that address priority food systems questions and challenges ranging in scope from food production, processing, distribution,
    access, consumption and dietary practices, to the management of food waste. Applied research projects in ISLFS often
    address sustainable solutions to food systems challenges that may address environmental, economic and social dimensions
    of food systems.

  </div>
  [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
  <div class="paragraph">

    Arguably the most important challenge for the world community in the 21st century is global food security: our ability to
    create a sufficient, healthy, safe, culturally relevant and economically accessible food system for everyone. Sustainable
    food systems will require more than technological advances, and must integrate economic, social and environmental relationships,
    thus involving community, land and food systems. New solutions will demand that researchers and policy makers approach
    the task differently from in the past. We can no longer expect solutions to come from a single discipline. The Integrated
    Studies in Land and Food Systems graduate program offers you the opportunity to focus on such key complex issues. It
    encourages you to use holistic approaches that integrate knowledge from across disciplines to find solutions relevant
    to diverse communities. The Integrated Studies in Land and Food Systems program (ISLFS) is for graduate students wishing
    to work within emerging interdisciplinary fields.

  <div class="paragraph">

    Admission is in accordance with requirements set by <a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/prospective-students/application-admission/admission-requirements">UBC’s
      Faculty of Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies</a>. Application to the ISLFS is not restricted to students with a degree
    in one of the disciplines in agricultural sciences or agroecology. Successful applicants can come from any recognized
    university degree program, and this diversity is reflected in the current graduate students enrolled in the program.
    Prospective students should consult the general LFS Graduate Admissions page for more information. Application deadlines
    for MSc/PhD applicants:
    <ul>
      <li>For September 2018 start date, the deadline is January 1, 2018.</li>
      <li>For January 2019 start date, the deadline is June 1, 2018.</li>
      <li>For May 2019 start date, the deadline is September 1, 2018.</li>
    </ul>
    In order to receive full funding consideration, applicants must have all documents submitted by January 30.

  </div>
  [/tab] [tab title="Degree Requirements"]
  <div class="paragraph">

    Master's students will complete and present their research proposal along with most of their courses within the first year
    of their program. Normally they will be expected to defend their dissertation at the end of their second year. Doctoral
    students will usually complete coursework and their candidacy exam within three years, and the defence of their doctoral
    dissertation in their forth or fifth years. The minimum course requirements for master's degrees are 30 credits, of which
    at least 18 must be numbered 500 and above. A maximum of 6 credits at the undergraduate level in courses numbered 300
    to 499 may be counted toward the requirements of a master’s degree. The MSc research thesis (LFS 549) is 12 credits.
    Coursework, selected in consultation with the student’s supervisory committee, includes graduate courses in Land and
    Food Systems and from other areas relevant to each student’s research. Please consult the UBC Calendar for course timetable
    details. Outline of program(s) for typical students (details of the required courses can be found <a href="http://courses.landfood.ubc.ca/">here</a>):
