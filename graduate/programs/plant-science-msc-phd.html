    <h3 class="intro">If you're committed to furthering the development of sustainable managed agroecosystems, UBC's graduate programs in Plant Science are where you want to be. This is where you can go deep in the area of plant biology, advancing your studies and conducting applied research in plant production, protection, biotechnology, physiology and biochemistry, as well as in plant-environment interaction. We place high value on an interdisciplinary approach, so you'll have the opportunity to collaborate with faculty in other graduate programs as you examine solutions to some of today's most challenging problems.</h3>

    <h2> What you need to know </h2>
    [tabs] [tab title="Why Pursue Graduate Studies in Plant Science at UBC?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>Our Plant Science graduate program places your scholarly advancement squarely in your own hands: in consultation with your research supervisor, you will tailor your studies to your particular professional goals and research interests. The collaboration doesn't end there, though. You have the opportunity — and are encouraged — to develop your research program through an interdisciplinary approach involving other departments and faculty on campus, broadening your knowledge in a way that's reflected in real-world systems. Another plus? You're studying in British Columbia, where the diversity of plant agriculture gives you an enormous range of cropping systems to choose from that are most suitable for your thesis research.</p>
      <p>UBC offers excellent facilities for your thesis research right here on the UBC campus, in the MacMillan Building, the <a href="http://ubcfarm.ubc.ca/">Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm</a>, Totem Field Laboratory, the <a href="http://wine.landfood.ubc.ca/">UBC Wine Research Centre</a>, the <a href="https://www.msl.ubc.ca/">Michael Smith Laboratories</a> and the Horticulture Glasshouse. Some Plant Science graduate students also work with our adjunct professors, many of whom are spread throughout the province of British Columbia.</p>
