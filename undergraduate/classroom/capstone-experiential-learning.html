  <h2>Undergraduate Thesis</h2>
  <p>If you're keen on research or intend to pursue a research-intensive graduate program, we encourage you to consider completing
    an undergraduate thesis. (Available in both the FNH and APBI programs, these courses are numbered 499.) The undergraduate
    thesis gives you an opportunity to work closely with a faculty member, and to work with the material at an advanced level.
    This project may be of your own design, or it may be part of your supervisor's ongoing research. Working on an undergraduate
    thesis will give you an idea of what it's like to work at the graduate level, focusing in depth on a single topic. It
    will also give you the opportunity to practice and apply your skills in experimental design, data collection and data
    analysis. And just like a graduate-level thesis, it will equip you with experience in academic writing and oral presentation.
    You'll be encouraged to present your work at the UBC
    <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/career/career-events/multidisciplinary-undergraduate-research-conference">Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference (MURC)</a>, and you may even be able to submit your work for publication
    in a peer-reviewed journal. That's a pretty great all-around project for an undergrad!
  </p>
  <p>If the undergraduate thesis appeals to you, we strongly recommended that you complete a research methods class (FNH or
    APBI 398) beforehand; that will help prepare you for the expectations of this kind of undertaking.
  </p>
  <p>One other thing: if you are in the Honours program for your degree, the undergraduate thesis may be a required element.
  </p>
  <h3>Credit value:</h3>
  <p>All undergraduate thesis courses are worth 6 credits, which means they require a significant investment of time and passion.</p>
  <h3>Registration and thesis approval process:</h3>
  <p>It is your responsibility to find an academic supervisor for your thesis, so if you're planning to complete one, we advise
    you to begin seeking an academic supervisor early! You should contact your designated program advisor for your major
    as well as the individual faculty member(s) with whom you are interested in conducting a project. Do this well in advance
    of the start of the academic term. For example, you should approach potential supervisors in the summer regarding projects
    which would begin in September. Opportunities for conducting projects are limited.</p>

  <h2>Undergraduate Essay</h2>
  <p>Available in the APBI program only, the undergraduate essay (APBI 498) allows you to complete a comprehensive and analytical
    literature review of an approved topic under the supervision of a faculty member. If you take this route, you will typically
    complete your essay in the final year of your program. The topic may be one that you have a particular interest in, or
    you may develop a topic under the advisement of your supervisor.</p>
  <p>The undergraduate essay is like a "thesis lite"; you get to explore a topic of deep interest, without the hands-on lab/field
    component of a thesis.</p>
  <h3>Credit value:</h3>
  <p>Undergraduate essay courses are worth 3 credits, and require a significant investment of time and passion. </p>
  <h3>Registration and essay approval process:</h3>
  <p>It is your responsibility to find an academic supervisor for your undergraduate essay. If you're planning to go this route,
    start seeking an academic supervisor early! Get in touch with your designated program advisor for your major as well
    as the individual faculty member(s) with whom you are interested in conducting a project well in advance of the beginning
    of the academic term. For example, you should approach potential supervisors in the early summer regarding projects which
    would start in September.</p>

  <h3>Questions?</h3>
  <p>If you have questions about the undergraduate essay, talk to your program advisor to discuss how this option could fit
    within your program requirements. Not sure who your program advisor is? It'll be listed on the webpage for your major.</p>
