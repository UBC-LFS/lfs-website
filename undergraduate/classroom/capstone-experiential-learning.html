<div class="row-fluid border-bottom" id="undergraduate-thesis">
  <h2>Undergraduate Thesis</h2>
  <p>If you're keen on research or intend to pursue a research-intensive graduate program, we encourage you to consider completing
    an undergraduate thesis. (Available in both the FNH and APBI programs, these courses are numbered 499.) The undergraduate
    thesis gives you an opportunity to work closely with a faculty member, and to work with the material at an advanced level.
    This project may be of your own design, or it may be part of your supervisor's ongoing research. Working on an undergraduate
    thesis will give you an idea of what it's like to work at the graduate level, focusing in depth on a single topic. It
    will also give you the opportunity to practice and apply your skills in experimental design, data collection and data
    analysis. And just like a graduate-level thesis, it will equip you with experience in academic writing and oral presentation.
    You'll be encouraged to present your work at the UBC
    <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/career/career-events/multidisciplinary-undergraduate-research-conference">Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference (MURC)</a>, and you may even be able to submit your work for publication
    in a peer-reviewed journal. That's a pretty great all-around project for an undergrad!
  </p>
  <p>If the undergraduate thesis appeals to you, we strongly recommended that you complete a research methods class (FNH or
    APBI 398) beforehand; that will help prepare you for the expectations of this kind of undertaking.
  </p>
  <p>One other thing: if you are in the Honours program for your degree, the undergraduate thesis may be a required element.
  </p>
  <h3>Credit value:</h3>
  <p>All undergraduate thesis courses are worth 6 credits, which means they require a significant investment of time and passion.</p>
  <h3>Registration and thesis approval process:</h3>
  <p>It is your responsibility to find an academic supervisor for your thesis, so if you're planning to complete one, we advise
    you to begin seeking an academic supervisor early! You should contact your designated program advisor for your major
    as well as the individual faculty member(s) with whom you are interested in conducting a project. Do this well in advance
    of the start of the academic term. For example, you should approach potential supervisors in the summer regarding projects
    which would begin in September. Opportunities for conducting projects are limited.</p>

<div class="row-fluid border-bottom" id="directed-studies">
  <h2>Directed Studies</h2>
  <p>Directed studies credits (courses numbered 497) are available across all three undergraduate programs (GRS, FNH and APBI).
    In directed studies, you'll work on a one-to-one basis with a faculty mentor on a research project. Similar to the undergraduate
    thesis, the end product will be your development and delivery of a research project of your own design, or the research you have done as part of
    an ongoing project. Most often this work is done within a lab or field setting, but other kinds of projects
    (e.g. those that are primarily literature-focused) may be approved. Directed studies are a great way to gain valuable
    research experience. Directed studies that have a small credit value (e.g. 2 or 3 credits) are a less time- and energy-intense 
    commitment than a 6-credit directed study. A 6-credit directed study is appropriate when your project is industry-sponsored and might contain
    or generate proprietary information, as the final report will not be a public document like a thesis. Your final report
    will give you valuable experience with scientific writing — and you may get to hone your public speaking skills with
    an oral presentation.</p>
  <h3>Credit value:</h3>
  <p>Normally, directed studies courses are worth 3 or 6 credits, but it's possible to also pursue a 2-credit version.</p>
  <h3>Registration and directed studies approval process:</h3>
  <p>It is your responsibility to find an academic supervisor for your directed studies. If you're planning to undertake directed
    studies, start seeking an academic supervisor well ahead of when you want to begin. You should contact your designated
    program advisor as well as the individual faculty member(s) with whom you are interested in conducting a project far
    in advance of the beginning of the academic term. For example, you should approach potential supervisors in the early
    summer regarding projects which would start in September. Opportunities for conducting projects are limited.</p>

  <h2>Undergraduate Essay</h2>
  <p>Available in the APBI program only, the undergraduate essay (APBI 498) allows you to complete a comprehensive and analytical
    literature review of an approved topic under the supervision of a faculty member. If you take this route, you will typically
    complete your essay in the final year of your program. The topic may be one that you have a particular interest in, or
    you may develop a topic under the advisement of your supervisor.</p>
  <p>The undergraduate essay is like a "thesis lite"; you get to explore a topic of deep interest, without the hands-on lab/field
    component of a thesis.</p>

<div class="row-fluid border-bottom" id="practicum">
  <h2>Practicums &amp; Internships</h2>
  <p>
    The Applied Biology Practicum (APBI 496) and LFS Career Development Internship (LFS 496) are ways for you to gain practical
    experience in your coursework. In these courses, you will work side-by-side with faculty mentors to develop and deliver
    your project(s).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to gain experience in potential fields of future employment working with organizations or companies related to
    your major, the APBI practicum will be of interest to you.
  </p>
  <p>
    The LFS Career Development Internship (LFS 496) is open to all students in all programs. It's an excellent opportunity for
    you to earn credits while being engaged with a mentor in a local company whose business is food system-related. It's
    also a great opportunity for you to get your hands dirty with existing projects at the UBC Farm. Many of these projects
    include the opportunity to conduct original research with supervision. Check out the listings of available internships
    and timelines for applications at the
    <a href="http://ubcfarm.ubc.ca/students/internships/">Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm</a>. You can also use your own connections to find an internship placement
    with a local business or organization.
  </p>
  <h3>Credit value:</h3>
  <p>You can earn a maximum of 6 credits of internships, either as one 6-credit option or two 3-credit projects.</p>
  <h3>Registration and approval process:</h3>
  <p>You can apply in February, July and November for internships that start in May, September and January. Get in touch with
    your designated program advisor for your major to see how an internship can fit into your program of study. The time
    commitment is generally one of:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      three months, 9h/week;
    </li>
    <li>
      six months, 9h/week; or

  <h2>Summer Abroad Programs</h2>
  <p>
    Our Faculty maintains partnerships with several universities around the globe that offer summer programs for which you can
    earn program credits. Summer Abroad is a great way to earn credits while enjoying an immersive cultural experience in another
    country, be it France's wine regions, taking in Copenhagen, or in the jungles of Costa Rica. Programs differ in length,
    start date and number of credits that can be transferred back to your program. Often you'll even have the opportunity to
    complete a practicum after the course to deepen your experience. Some programs offer partnership prices, which make them
    an especially economical way to travel and earn credits at the same time.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Credit value:
  </h3>
  <p>
    You'll need to check out each program to see how many credits you can earn, as this can vary from 3 to 12. (European program
    credits are given in ECTS (European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System); just remember, two ECTS = one UBC credit!)
  </p>
  <h3>
    Registration and approval process:
  </h3>
  <p>
    You will need to plan ahead and register for any summer programs by February 1. Make sure that you have talked with the Global

<div class="row-fluid border-bottom" id="lfs-core-series">
  <h2>LFS Core Series</h2>
  <p>
    As an LFS student, you'll take at least two courses from the LFS core series (
    <a href="http://wiki.ubc.ca/Course:LFS100">LFS 100</a> and
    <a href="http://lfs250.landfood.ubc.ca/">LFS 250</a>) as part of your degree requirements. Depending on your program of choice, you may also be required to take
    <a href="http://lfs350.landfood.ubc.ca/">LFS 350</a>, with
    <a href="http://wiki.ubc.ca/Course:LFS450">LFS 450</a> as an option. (LFS 350 and LFS 450 are recommended as electives in all programs that don’t already include
    them.)
  </p>
  <p>
    The LFS core series embraces a different kind of learning, where assessment by your instructors is based more on process
    than on outcomes. You'll be working on big issues, where ambiguity and uncertainty are part of the natural terrain, and
    where there's not necessarily a "right" answer. If you're used to multiple-choice thinking, you're about to experience
    a whole new way of showing what you know.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the core series, you'll work collectively to solve problems and address issues. You'll be presenting and speaking with
    groups more often than you've done before. You'll be writing more. You'll be learning how to be accountable not just
    to yourself, but to the other people you're connected with on a project, from peers to instructors to community partners.
    And you'll be shaping all that learning not just off-site, in the community, and in small groups that go beyond the traditional
    lecture/lab structure, but inside a flipped-classroom paradigm, where you're no longer just a knowledge consumer but
    are increasingly a knowledge creator.
  </p>
  <p>
    The LFS faculty has shaped this educational approach over a number of years, and it's backed by some pretty powerful research.
    This way of learning is very reflective of how things actually work in the real world — and that's what we're getting
    you ready for. Our work here in LFS is to equip you with knowledge, but it's also to educate professionals who are ground-ready
    to cope with the demands of a variety of different careers. As part of your studies, we incorporate the practical experiences
    that are increasingly required in the career sphere — things like building your network outside the UBC community and
    collaborating on interdisciplinary projects through community-based experiential learning (CBEL). No matter your background
    or discipline, the LFS core series primes you to enter the workforce as a competent, inquiry-minded and collaborative
    professional.
