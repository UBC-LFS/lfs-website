    <p>
        Dreading that upcoming presentation? Curious about how to be a good group member? We don't all have the same level of skill
        or prior training in these things. But the
        <a href="http://learningcommons.ubc.ca/">UBC Learning Commons</a> website has your back. That's where UBC experts have curated some great information and
        resources that'll help you master those job-ready skills. The payoff for investing some time now to learn new work
        strategies will prove invaluable in the future. Even if you take away only one new idea to put into practice, you're
        going to see improvements to your in-classroom experience and your academic success.</p><p>

<h2>Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS)</h2>
    <p>Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) are free, structured group study sessions designed to help students understand key concepts and practice the skills necessary for success in traditionally challenging courses. PASS sessions complement what you learn while attending lectures, but are not a replacement. They’re also a great way to meet other Forestry or Land and Food Systems students in your classes.</p>
<p>Our sessions are welcoming, supportive and engaging, and help students understand course concepts and develop study strategies for the specific subject matter. They are facilitated by upper-year Forestry and Land and Food Systems students who have been successful in the course in previous years. </p>
</p>
<p>In 2018/19, PASS Leaders will be offering small group sessions to support students taking:</p>
<ul>
    <p><li>Term 1: CHEM 111 and CHEM 121</li></p>
    <p><li>Term 2: APBI 200 and CHEM 123</li></p></ul>
<p>Sessions are designed to help students:</p><ul>
    <p><li>Gain a more in-depth understanding of the course content</li></p>
    <p><li>Meet students from their class in a small group setting</li></p>
    <p><li>Test their knowledge about their course prior to tests and exams</li></p>
    <p><li>Develop transferable study skills</li></p></ul>
<p>Research has shown that the more PASS sessions students attend, the greater likelihood they are of improving their overall understanding of key concepts, which results in achieving higher grades. We hope that we see you at one or more of our sessions each week!</p>
<p><b>Who facilitates PASS sessions?</b></p>
<p>Sessions are run by senior undergraduate students in Forestry and Land and Food Systems who have been trained to incorporate a variety of different activities, games, practice questions, mock quizzes and techniques to help you progress each week throughout the semester. PASS sessions are not like lectures or tutorials; they are not structured as a passive review session or a FAQ.</p>

They are facilitated by upper-year Forestry and Land and Food Systems students who have been successful in the course in previous years. </p>
</p>
<p>In 2018/19, PASS Leaders will be offering small group sessions to support students taking:</p>
<ul>
    <p><li>Term 1: CHEM 111 and CHEM 121</li></p>
    <p><li>Term 2: APBI 200 and CHEM 123</li></p></ul>
<p>Sessions are designed to help students:</p><ul>
    <p><li>Gain a more in-depth understanding of the course content</li></p>
    <p><li>Meet students from their class in a small group setting</li></p>
    <p><li>Test their knowledge about their course prior to tests and exams</li></p>
    <p><li>Develop transferable study skills</li></p></ul>
<p>Research has shown that the more PASS sessions students attend, the greater likelihood they are of improving their overall understanding of key concepts, which results in achieving higher grades. We hope that we see you at one or more of our sessions each week!</p>
<p><b>Who facilitates PASS sessions?</b></p>
<p>Sessions are run by senior undergraduate students in Forestry and Land and Food Systems who have been trained to incorporate a variety of different activities, games, practice questions, mock quizzes and techniques to help you progress each week throughout the semester. PASS sessions are not like lectures or tutorials; they are not structured as a passive review session or a FAQ.</p>
