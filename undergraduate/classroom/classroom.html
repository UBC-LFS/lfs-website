    <h3 class="intro">You may not realize it, but many of your LFS projects and assessments are preparing you for life after graduation. Things
        like research, presentation skills, group work and project management are examples of transferable skills that will
        serve you well in your future career, so keep your focus on getting the most out of each individual course.

    <h3 class="intro">Learning doesnâ€™t happen only in the lecture hall, though. From global learning opportunities and co-op experiences to
        working on the UBC Farm and field studies that let you apply your education hands-on, there are many ways to complement
        your in-classroom experience and invest in your own academic success.</h3>
