  <h3 class="intro">LFS offers many ways for you to deepen your academic experience. If you're a 3rd- or 4th-year student
    wishing to clearly demonstrate competency and mastery of your major, or if you just want to enrich your degree with a
    unique learning opportunity, this page is for you. These opportunities are engineered to help you transition from being
    a student to the next step in your career, whether that's graduate studies or a smooth entry into the working world.</h3>

  <h2>Undergraduate Thesis</h2>
  <p>If you're particularly keen on research or intend to pursue a research-intensive graduate program, you are encouraged
    to consider completing an undergraduate thesis (available in both the FNH and APBI programs, these courses are numbered
    499). The undergraduate thesis gives you an opportunity to work closely with a faculty member, with the material at an
    advanced level. This project may be of your own design, or it may be part of your supervisor's ongoing research. Working
    on an undergraduate thesis will give you an idea of what it's like to work at the graduate level focusing in depth on
    a single topic. It will also give you the opportunity to practice and apply your skills in experimental design, data
    collection and data analysis. And just like a graduate-level thesis, it will equip you with experience in academic writing
    and oral presentation. You are encouraged to present your work at the <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/career/career-events/multidisciplinary-undergraduate-research-conference">
      UBC Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference (MURC)
    </a> and in exceptional cases, you may even be able to submit your work for publication in a peer reviewed journal.
  </p>
  <p>If you are in the Honours program for your degree, the undergraduate thesis may be required.
  </p>
  <p>The thesis isn’t for everyone; of the independent study options, the thesis is the most challenging. If you have an
    interest in research, but are not committed to this level of engagement, consider a Directed Studies – see below!
  </p>
  <h3>Credit value:</h3>
  <p>All undergraduate thesis courses are worth 6 credits, which means they require a significant investment of time and
    passion.
  </p>
  <h3>Registration and thesis approval process:</h3>
  <p>
    You will need a strong academic foundation to be considered for an undergrad thesis. It is your responsibility to find an
    academic supervisor for your thesis, so start looking early! You should contact your designated program advisor for your
    major (see below for quick links) as well as the individual faculty member(s) with whom you are interested in conducting
    a project. Do this well in advance of the start of the academic term. We strongly encourage you to start looking at least
    4 months in advance of when you would want to be registered in this course. For example, you should approach potential
    supervisors in the summer regarding projects which would begin in September. Opportunities for conducting projects are
    limited.

<div class="row-fluid border-bottom" id="undergraduate-essay">
  <h2>Undergraduate Essay</h2>
  <p>Available in the APBI program only, the undergraduate essay (course number: APBI 498) allows you to complete a comprehensive
    analysis of the peer-reviewed literature of an approved topic under the supervision of a faculty member. Unlike the Undergraduate
    Thesis, the essay does not require you to conduct original research. If you take this route, you will typically complete
    your essay in a single term in the final year of your program. The topic is normally determined together with your supervisor.
  </p>
  <p>Students normally enroll in either the Undergraduate Thesis or the Undergraduate Essay, not both. In exceptional cases,
    students may do both, and this would require approval from their supervisor. </p>
  <h3>Credit value:</h3>
  <p>Undergraduate essay courses are worth 3 credits, and require a significant investment of time and passion. </p>
  <h3>Registration and essay approval process:</h3>
  <p>It is your responsibility to find an academic supervisor for your undergraduate essay, so start looking early! Get in
    touch with your designated program advisor for your major as well as the individual faculty member(s) with whom you are
    interested in conducting a project well in advance of the beginning of the academic term. We strongly encourage you to
    start looking at least 4 months in advance of when you would want to be registered in this course. For example, you should
    approach potential supervisors in the summer regarding essay topics which would start in September.</p>

  <h2>Practicums &amp; Internships</h2>
  <p>
    The Applied Biology Practicum (APBI 496) and LFS Career Development Internship (LFS 496) are ways for you to gain practical
    experience in your field of study. In these courses, you work alongside on-site mentors (which could include academic
    faculty, industry or community partners), to develop skills and knowledge in a particular field. This is hands-on learning
    in its true sense! Each of these courses is supervised by a faculty member.
  </p>
  <p>For the APBI Practicum, the number of placements available each term is limited. You cannot register yourself –you must
    apply and be accepted. To review the course syllabus, and current practicum opportunities, go <a href="http://awp.landfood.ubc.ca/degrees-courses/undergraduate-courses/apbi-496/">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The LFS Career Development Internship (LFS 496) is open to students in all programs and an excellent opportunity for you
    to earn credits while being engaged with a mentor in a local company whose business is food system related. You can also
    get your hands dirty with existing projects at the UBC Farm. Many of these projects include the opportunity to conduct
    original research with supervision. Check out the listings of all available internships and timelines for applications
    at the <a href="http://ubcfarm.ubc.ca/students/internships/">Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm</a>.
    You can also use your own connections to find an internship company for your placement.
  </p>
  <h3>Credit value:</h3>
  <p>You can earn a maximum of 6 credits of internships, either as one 6-credit option or two 3-credit projects.</p>
  <h3>Registration and approval process:</h3>
  <p>For LFS 496: you apply for in Februa, respectively. Get in touch with your designated program advisor for your major
    to see how the Internship can fit in your program of study.</p>

<div class="row-fluid" id="directed-studies">
  <h2>Directed Studies</h2>
  <p>Directed studies credits (courses numbered 497) are available across all three undergraduate programs (GRS, FNH and
    APBI). In directed studies, you will work on a one-to-one basis with a faculty mentor on an academic project. The Directed
    Studies incorporates elements of the Thesis and a Practicum. </p>
  <p>
    Directed Studies allow for flexibility and for you to delve more deeply in to a topic of interest to you. While similar to
    the Thesis and Essay, Directed Studies do not require a research component. Your final report will give you valuable
    experience with scientific writing — and you may get to hone your public speaking skills with an oral presentation.
  </p>
  <p>
    When your project is industry-sponsored and might contain or generate proprietary information, the final report will not
    be a public document, as is the case with the thesis or essay.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will be required to prepare a proposal with your academic supervisor with clear learning outcomes and rubric for evaluation
    that must be signed off by your program advisor.
  </p>
  <h3>Credit value:</h3>
  <p>Normally, directed studies courses are normally worth 3 or 6 credits, but it's possible to also pursue a 2-credit version.</p>
  <h3>Registration and directed studies approval process:</h3>
  <p>It is your responsibility to find an academic supervisor for your directed studies. If you're planning to undertake
    directed studies, start seeking an academic supervisor well ahead of when you want to begin. You should contact your
    designated program advisor as well as the individual faculty member(s) with whom you are interested in conducting a project,
    well in advance of the beginning of the academic term. We strongly encourage you to start looking at least 4 months in
    advance of when you would want to be registered in this course. For example, you should approach potential supervisors
    in the beginning of the summer regarding projects which would start in September. Opportunities for conducting projects
    are limited.</p>
