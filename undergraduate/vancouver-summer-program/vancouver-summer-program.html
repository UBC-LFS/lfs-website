[accordion title="Package A - Food Science and Sensory Evaluation"]
<h4><strong>Introduction to Food Science</strong></h4>
<p>
  An introduction to key concepts related to the science of food: the Canadian food system, chemical and physical properties of foods, government regulations, food additives, food preservation techniques, food safety, and trends in foods for nutrition and health. You will learn to arrive at an informed position about controversial issues relating to the food that you will encounter as consumers in the marketplace, and that you hear about in the media. Come and explore activities of entomophagy (eating insects), molecular gastronomy, and 3-D food printing.
</p>
<h4><strong>The Science of Sensory Evaluation</strong></h4>
<p>
  The sensory characteristics of a food are critical in the development of new food products and determine their success in the marketplace. Sensory evaluation is a science measuring human responses to food sensory attributes of texture, flavor, smell, and color. There are special challenges in sensory evaluation because people are subject to various environmental, psychological and culture biases, and pose ethical considerations. In this hands-on course, you will explore techniques used to generate and analyze sensory data. You will apply the sensory evaluation theory that you learn, by participating in evaluations as both panelist and sensory analyst.
