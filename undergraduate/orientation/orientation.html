  <h2>Imagine UBC</h2>
  <h3>All new undergraduate students</h3>
  <p>Tuesday, September 4, 2018 is your first day at UBC, which is celebrated as Imagine Day. There are no classes this day;
    instead, an upper-year LFS student (called an Orientation Leader) will guide you through a full day of programming, which
    includes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      a tour of campus
    </li>
    <li>
      meeting the Dean, LFS faculty members and staff
    </li>
    <li>
      learning more about resources, support services, and LFS student groups
    </li>
    <li>
      AND enjoying free food and UBC swag!
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>One of the highlights of the day is joining over 6,000 new students at UBC’s Thunderbird Arena for the pep rally that will
    get you excited for the year ahead. Afterwards, you can learn about UBC’s many services, resources, clubs, and programs
    by strolling through the Main Event along Main Mall (the main pedestrian corridor on campus).</p>
  <p>Whether you are a high school student or a transfer student from another institution, Imagine UBC is for you. In late August,
    keep an eye out for an email from us - you will be sent your schedule for the day and you’ll also receive a welcome email
    from your Orientation Leader.</p>
  <p>On Imagine Day, don’t forget to wear your Faculty colour, black! (That should be easy!)</p>

    learn about UBC and LFS beyond Imagine Day.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>

    <li>
      <strong>LFS Firsts</strong>: LFS Firsts is a 1-night, 2-day retreat to welcome the incoming LFS first-years in your transition
      to university! You can expect to form new connections, spark new friendships, and fully embrace your first moments
      together as LFS students. The purpose of the camp is to unite first year students coming from various backgrounds and
      to provide a strong foundation for you to start something new together. It will be happening September 22-23, 2018
