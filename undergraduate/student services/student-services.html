    <h2>Information for Faculty Members</h2>
    <h3>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Itaque eveniet nulla distinctio amet, sequi expedita sapiente

    [accordions collapsible=true] [accordion title="Support for Students"]
    <p>Faculty members are in a unique position in that you see students on a regular basis and can often observe changes in
        behaviour, attendance or academics that indicate a student may be experiencing challenges outside the classroom (illness,
        personal challenges, family tragedies, etc.). If you have concerns about a student's wellbeing, please take the time
        to educate yourself about
        <a href="https://facultystaff.students.ubc.ca/assisting-students-distress">Assisting Students in Distress</a>, and notify
        <a href="mailto:students@landfood.ubc.ca">LFS Student Services</a> for any cases that you feel our support would be beneficial. We can often liaise with other
        resources and support services on campus to ensure the student is receiving the support they need, as well as advise
        the student on how to manage their whole academic portfolio in the face of challenge. We are available to provide
        guidance and support for you as well as your students, and encourage you to reach out to us with any questions or
        concerns.
    </p>
    <p>We strongly encourage all faculty to retain a copy of the
        <a href="https://facultystaff.students.ubc.ca/sites/facultystaff.students.ubc.ca/files/green-folder-sexual-assault-insert.pdf">'Green Folder,'</a> the mental health and wellbeing resource guide for Assisting Students in Distress provided by
        our colleagues in UBC Student Development and Services. If you would like a hard copy, please contact
        <a href="mailto:students@landfood.ubc.ca">LFS Student Services</a> to request one.</p>
    [/accordion] [accordion title="Grade Submission Deadlines"]
    <p>As per the
        <a href="https://facultystaff.students.ubc.ca/files/FSCUserGuide.pdf">FSC (Faculty Service Centre) User Guide</a>, final grades are due 7 business days from the exam date OR 5 business
        days from the exam date, if the exam is written on the last two days of the exam period. For Directed Studies, Undergraduate
        Thesis and Essay courses, we kindly ask that instructors use the
        <a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/vancouver/termdates">end of term dates</a> for grade submission deadlines. We appreciate your commitment to meeting these deadlines as
        late submissions can prevent students from meeting eligibility requirements for year promotion, academic standing
        evaluations, graduation or other critical stages of their academic progression. If you have concerns about meeting
        these deadlines, we kindly ask you notify
        <a href="mailto:students@landfood.ubc.ca">LFS Student Services</a> so that we may work together to ensure students records are up to date and impacts to their
        progress are mitigated.</p>
    [/accordion] [accordion title="Registration, Exam &amp; Scheduling Inquiries"]
    <p>We work together with the Associate Dean, Academic and Program Directors to ensure the Summer and Winter schedules are
