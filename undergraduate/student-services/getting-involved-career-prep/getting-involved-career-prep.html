  <h3 class="intro">You're here to learn, right? But learning doesn't just happen in the lecture hall. When you expand your university experience
    by becoming involved in your campus and community, you learn so much more about yourself. And if you want to build a
    career that's filled with interesting things and people, self-knowledge is the name of the game. UBC and LFS offer loads
    of experiences both in and out of the classroom where you can try new things. You never know how you'll grow — but as
    long as you stay open to new experiences and follow what interests you the most, you're going to be way ahead of other
    people who don't have that kind of clarity. There is no "right" way to make a memorable UBC experience, so get inspired
    by what LFS and UBC have to offer, and get out there!</h3>

  <p>University is a time of discovery. You'll have myriad opportunities to reaffirm your path (or discover new passions you
    didn't know about), meet people who share your values and interests, and push yourself outside your comfort zone in trying
    something new. The experiences you have will shape the person you'll become — and the memories you create will last a
    lifetime. Developing all the different aspects of yourself is a fun job, but more than that, it positions you for long-term
    success.
  </p>
  <p>Times are changing, and careers are more fluid now than they've ever been. It really is up to you to determine what you
    want — and it's entirely within your power to make that happen. You are the only one who makes your choices, which means
    you're the one in charge of where you're going! Challenge yourself to remain flexible and open, and put energy into developing
    your experiences and your network of people. The relationships you build are like keys that can unlock different doors
    as you move through your life.</p>
  <p>When you get involved with an initiative either in or out of the classroom, it's true that you are building certain specific
    skills. But you'll also be developing incidental skills right alongside. All the experiences you engage in shape the
    person you are becoming, and can set you more firmly in the path of developing a career that's exactly right for you.
    Take every opportunity to try new things that interest you. Research shows that students who get involved do better in
    school, and the skills you'll learn through your non-academic experiences can do as much to prepare you for your career
    as your deep academic learning.</p>

  <h2>Ways to build your experience</h2>
  <p>UBC and LFS have created numerous avenues for you to follow your interests, and to build your repertoire of career-transferable
    skills. Whether you choose to expand your skills through a co-op, working on campus or connecting up with an industry
    mentor, you'll be positioning yourself well for employability after graduation. Read the chart below, and explore your
    options more deeply through the links.</p>

              <p>Consider working on campus through the Work Learn program to gain useful skills and meet new people, or volunteer

  <h2>Where can your LFS degree take you?</h2>
  <p>First off, realize that you're coming to university not just to learn a specific block of skills. You're here to learn
    about your subject area, but you're also here to learn about what fires up your curiosity — and how to keep learning
    once you leave UBC's fold.</p>
  <p>We've already mentioned that the workplace isn't what it used to be. Change happens quickly now, and people who remain
    flexible and adaptive to change are the most able to come through the other side smiling. Be aware that you might not
    enter your dream job right out of university — very few people do! Your job as a human is to keep following your interests
    and learning more about the things that capture your curiosity. That's what will lead you to deep pleasure in your work.
    All through the life span you will continue learning: new skills, new relationships, new ideas. Embrace this learning,
    and embrace change as it comes to you. It's okay to change your mind, too: just because you came to LFS with a certain
    goal in mind, if something tweaks your interest and inspires you to change direction, go that way.</p>
  <p>One thing is for sure: every LFS grad will be prepared for a fulfilling career. Keep following your interests, because
    that's the best way to set yourself up for a career that excites you.</p>

    the kinds of careers our alumni have gone on to create.</p>
