   [accordion title="I received credit that looks something like this: PHIL 2<sup>nd</sup> (3) – what does that mean, and how does it apply to my degree? "]
    <p>This is a type of transfer credit called <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=2,25,75,0">unassigned credit</a>. Unassigned credit may be granted when course-to-course equivalency cannot be established. The name “PHIL” indicates which course code the course is most equivalent to at UBC (in this case, Philosophy). The “2nd” indicates what year level the credit has been assigned (in this case, it is a second year or 200-level equivalent course). The number in parentheses (3) indicates how many transfer credits you have been awarded for that course.

   [accordion title="Do I have to take LFS 100 as a transfer student?"]
    <p>If you are a transfer student into LFS, you are not required to take LFS 100 001. However, you must complete an exemption quiz in order to waive this requirement – therefore please register for LFS 100 XMT when you register for courses in June/July. You must be registered in LFS 100 XMT to receive information about the LFS 100 Exemption Quiz. An "exemption" is not the same as "credit". You will still need to complete the university's required number of credits for the degree program you are pursuing. Therefore, you may need to make up this 1 credit to meet your graduation requirements. </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="What is the LFS 100 exemption quiz and when do I need to take it by?"]
    <ul>
      <li>
        The LFS 100 exemption quiz is an exam that transfer students are eligible to complete so that they don’t need to actually take LFS 100 (a course that is designed for first-year students new to university life). Transfer students who are eligible to take this exam must register for LFS 100 XMT during their registration period, and will then be sent instructions in August of how to complete the exam online. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you would rather attend LFS 100 001 even if you are eligible for the exemption quiz, you may do so and register for a regular section of LFS 100. 
      </li>
      <li>
        PLEASE NOTE: If you are required to maintain a minimum credit load this year for reasons such as student loans, student housing, awards/scholarships, etc., please consider your eligibility requirements before electing to take the LFS 100 exemption quiz. If you are unsure if you meet these requirements please contact <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/student-services/#connect">LFS Student Services</a>. International students with student loan funding are encouraged to contact Student Services regarding the LFS 100 Exemption Quiz.         
      </li>
    </ul>

   [accordion title="How many of my transfer credits can apply to my LFS degree?"]
    <p>Please see UBC’s maximum allowable transfer credit policy <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=2,25,74,0">here</a>. Generally, no more than 60 credits may be transferred or 50% of required program credits.</p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="I transferred to and LFS program from another program at UBC – how many of my credits can be applied to my LFS degree?"]
    <p>
      While you were a UBC student during your time studying in another program, the same maximum allowable transfer credit policy (as above) does apply. Students must complete a minimum of 50% of their required program credits in both the program and Faculty they wish to graduate from.
