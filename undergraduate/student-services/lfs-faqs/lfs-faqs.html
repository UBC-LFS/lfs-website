    <p>
      You can find more information about this <a href="http://www.landfood.ubc.ca/student-services/registration-program-info/">here</a>. Once you’ve reviewed this information, if you still have questions about registering for courses, please contact LFS Student Services.

   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="Why is this course blocked from registration? There is an available seat, but I can’t register into the course I need."]
    <p>If a course is blocked from registration, it usually means that there is a waitlist for the course. Check to see if there is a waitlist available, and if there’s a waitlist, please register onto it. If the waitlist is full, please keep checking to see if space on the waitlist becomes available (as you won’t be able to register into the course, as it’s blocked, even if you see spots available). It’s a good idea to check for space as frequently as possible (ex. every hour, every few hours). </p>
    <p>If there is no waitlist available, check to see if there is a note on the UBC Course Schedule regarding why that particular course/section is blocked. If there is no note, the course may be full at that time.</p>
    <p>Some courses are blocked because they require special approval by your Program Advisor - so you won’t be able to register into the course yourself. Some examples of these types of courses are: Directed Studies, Career Internship, Undergrad Thesis/Essay, etc. Please review this website for more information.</p>

   [accordion title="How many courses should I take this year/per term?"]
    <p>
      That decision is up to you as it depends on the student. How many courses do you want to take each term? Do you have other commitments outside of school such as work or volunteering? Most students take 9-15 credits per term, so this would be 3-5 courses maximum. Please note, if you end up taking a reduced course load, this may delay your graduation, but students can try and catch up on course work over the summer (if the courses are offered). 
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend that students prioritize taking core/required courses during the Winter Sessions. Students can more easily defer some electives or courses that are traditionally offered in summer sessions the following summer. Please be aware of course prerequisites (ensure you are meeting them or going through your courses in a general sequential order) and <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,795,1645">Year Promotion</a> requirements for the following year – there may be some courses that are best taken in the Winter Session and not deferred to the summer! 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Faculty does not have a definition for “full-time” or “part-time” status, as we do not require students to take a minimum number of courses per year i.e. if you want to take 1 course per term, that’s fine! It will just take you longer to complete your degree. Having said that, students need to ensure they meet the minimum credit requirements for:    
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      	On campus student housing (residence) 
      </li>
      <li>
      	Maintaining your eligibility for any current or future scholarships, funding and/or student loans. (Please refer to your <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/enrolment-services-professionals-esp">Enrolment Services Professional</a> for more information). 
      </li>
      <li>
      	<a href="https://students.ubc.ca/international-student-guide">Immigration requirements</a> (study permit requirements and requirements to work on and off-campus).        
      </li>
    </ul>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="I&#39;m getting a warning that says I have exceeded my credit limit &#8209; why?"]
    <p>
      All students are allowed to take a maximum of 32-33 credits a year, which is ~5 courses a term. For more information, please read the following <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,795,1646">page</a>. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact LFS Student Services. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note, there is a pre-set limit to the number of credits you’re allowed to take per term – waitlists contribute to your overall credit requirement. 
    </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="How do I know if I&#39;m eligible to take a course? What are the steps to figure this out?"]
    <p>
      Check to see if you meet the prerequisites for the course. If you don’t meet the prerequisites, you aren’t eligible to take the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check to see what the seat restrictions are (please review other FAQ’s for more information). 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you meet the prerequisites/remaining seat restrictions for the course and there is still space available, you should be able to register for it.    
    </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="The course I want says it is 	&#34;restricted&#34;. What does that mean?!"]
    <p>
      If a section says “restricted” beside it on the UBC Course Schedule, it does not mean it is restricted to you (or not for you), specifically. It means that only restricted seats are available. Those restricted seats are allocated to various groups of students which could include year standing, Faculty (LFS, Science, etc.), a specific program (must be in BSFN) or grade (ex. must have 75% or above to take this course). In some cases a portion of the seats are reserved so that students who require this course to complete their program can register. In other cases, an entire course is restricted because students can only take it if they are in a specific program.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need to look at what the restricted seats are for each course and each section of a course that you want to take to see if you meet them, as they can vary between sections, and they can also change throughout the day during registration. If you meet the seat restrictions and you meet the prerequisites for the course, and there is space available, you should be able to register for the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are general seats available (seats that don’t have any restrictions on them, other than the course prerequisites), then any student should be able to register for those seats.
    </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="What is the difference between a prerequisite requirement and a seat restriction?"]
    <p>
      A prerequisite is a course that you need to have completed <i>prior</i> to registering for the selected course. If you don’t meet the prerequisite for a course, you are not eligible to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For information on what a seat restriction is, please review other FAQ’s for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students need to meet the prerequisites for a course and meet the seat restrictions, to be eligible to take a course.
    </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="When I test my registration, I get warnings saying I do not meet prerequisites…but I do!"]
    <p>
      With worklists, you can “test” your registration prior to your registration date/time. Many courses will have prerequisites and say “Restricted” on the UBC Course Schedule. For more information about this, please review please review other FAQ’s for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is the warning you’re seeing in yellow or red? 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      	If it’s in yellow, it’s simply just a warning to remind students to check that they are indeed eligible for the course. If you do have the prerequisites, you can ignore the error – when your date/time opens, you should be able to register yourself into the course, seats permitting. There is no need to contact the Faculty or department advisor regarding registration, despite the error message above.
      </li>
      <li>
      	If it’s in red, you don’t meet the course restrictions/prerequisites and you will not be able to register yourself into the course. If you feel this is an error and you do actually meet the prerequisites for a course (via transfer credits, etc.), please try and register onto a corresponding waitlist first and then contact LFS Student Services for additional help/questions.        
      </li>
    </ul>
    
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="What is the difference between a prerequisite and a corequisite?"]
    <p>
      A prerequisite is a course that the student must have completed <i>prior</i> to registering for the selected course.
    </p>
    <p>
      A corequisite is a course that the student must take prior to OR concurrently with the selected course. The UBC Course Schedule and some course descriptions show prerequisite/corequisite requirements where applicable.
    </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="LPI: what is it and do I need to take it?"]
    <p>
      The <a href="https://www.lpitest.ca/">Language Proficiency Index (LPI)</a> exam assesses a student’s readiness to pursue academic work in critical reading and writing at a university level.  This is different than the <a href="http://you.ubc.ca/applying-ubc/english-language-competency/">English Language competency requirement </a>(IELTS or TOEFL).
    </p>
    <p>
      The LPI exam can be used to meet the <a href="https://english.ubc.ca/first-year-english/frequently-asked-questions-faq/#1">First-Year English Course Entry Requirements</a>, if you do not meet any of the other requirements (e.g. a certain grade in English 11 or 12). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Please check to see if you meet the <a href="https://english.ubc.ca/first-year-english/frequently-asked-questions-faq/#1">First-Year English Course Entry Requirements</a> and if you don’t, you will need to take the LPI. Please pay attention to the deadlines listed under #4 on the website above, which outlines when you need to complete the LPI exam by, to remain registered in LFS 150 or ENGL 112. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Please review the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,795,875">UBC Academic Calendar</a> for more information.

   [accordion title="I am unable to declare my specialization &#8209; help!"]
    <p>
      If you’re a 2nd-year standing student in LFS – you may receive a warning that you won’t be able to register unless you declare a specialization (which is the same thing as a major in LFS). This is normally done through the Student Service Centre (SSC) but in the few days before your registration opens, this function is not available.
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend waiting until your registration opens and then trying again. You should be able to declare your specialization then by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Logging into your SSC under “Registration” –> “Specialization list” –> search by degree (either B.Sc. in Applied Biology or B.Sc. in Food, Nutrition and Health program) and then search for your specialization/major.</li>
    </ul>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="First Year Math &#8209; which one?!"]
    <p>
      There are a lot of first-year Math courses at UBC and it can be confusing trying to figure out which courses you have to take! Please review the <a href="http://www.math.ubc.ca/Ugrad/ugradCourses/ugradCal-choices.shtml">Math Departments website</a> for a complete breakdown of the courses and requirements. It is highly recommend that you review this website <i>before</i> registering for your first-year math courses. 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Differential Calculus: MATH 100, 102, 104, 180, 184, 110 are all equivalent, but with different applications and prerequisites, which is based on your high school Pre-Calculus grade and whether or not you took any calculus in high school. MATH 102 is generally recommended for all of our undergraduate programs, but we will accept any of the courses listed here towards this degree requirement.
      </li>
      <li>
        Integral Calculus: MATH 101, 103, 105 are all equivalent but with different applications. MATH 103 is generally recommended for all of our undergraduate programs, but we will accept any of the courses listed here towards this degree requirement.        
      </li>
    </ul>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="Credit/D/Fail &#8209; what is it and should I use it?"]
    <p>
      <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/courses/creditdfail-grading">Credit/D/Fail </a>is a great option for students wanting to take courses that aren’t related to their degree/program/major of study. For example, if you’ve never taken Portuguese before and you want to learn another language, or if you’re wanting to take a choir or drawing class, but you have no experience with choir/drawing, then this may be a good option for you. 
    </p>
    <p>
      LFS students may only take <i>Unrestricted elective</i> courses as Credit/D/Fail – Credit/D/Fail is NOT permitted for required core courses or restricted electives in LFS.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that Credit/D/Fail may affect your eligibility for scholarships, awards, and/or funding, or your admissibility to other professional or graduate programs later on. So it is recommended that you check with LFS Student Services before taking a course as Credit/D/Fail. You can learn more about this in the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,42,910,0">UBC Academic Calendar</a>.    
    </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="Waitlists waitlists waitlists!"]
    <p>
      Registering onto a waitlist is the only way to show interest in a course, when a course is already full or blocked from further registration. Another reason you may need to register onto a waitlist is if your transfer credits are generic (ex. CHEM 1st(4)) as the system won’t recognize them. Some courses have waitlists, and others don’t, so it’s important to check if a waitlist is available when a course is blocked/full. Seats usually open up in a course because students make changes to their schedules leading up to the add/drop deadlines each term. When this happens, students on the waitlist will be moved from the waitlist into the corresponding section in a priority sequence, by the department. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you see a spot become available, you do not need to do anything! Do not remove yourself from the waitlist and try to register into the course, as you will lose your spot on the waitlist (as well as your priority).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are on a waitlist, keep checking your SSC to see if you have been moved into the corresponding course. Students are not normally notified when they have been moved from the waitlist into the corresponding section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The department will monitor waitlists throughout the summer and into the start of term, therefore please be patient if you see a seat available. It is not an automatic process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, being on a waitlist doesn’t guarantee that you will get into a course, but it is often the only way to be considered for a course if it’s blocked from further registration.   
    </p>

   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="Do I have to take summer courses?"]
    <p>
      No, you don’t have to take summer courses if you don’t want to. Some students take summer courses to catch up on coursework or to try and get ahead on their coursework, but it’s not a requirement. 
    </p>

   [accordion title="What is BIOL 112? What are the prerequisites and how do I register for it?"]
    <p>
      Everything you need to know about BIOL 112 registration can be found on the UBC Microbiology Departments website <a href="http://www.microbiology.ubc.ca/undergraduate/biol-112-registration">here</a>.
    </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="What is a &#34;Primary Section&#34;? How do I register into BIOL 140 or BIOL 200?"]
    <p>
      BIOL 140 is a first-year biology laboratory course – students need to register for the “primary section” before they can register into the lab section they want. To register into this course, you need to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Register in 2 activity types (Lecture and Laboratory) to complete registration
      </li>
      <li>
        Register into BIOL 140 sec 101 (in Term 1) or sec 201 (in Term 2). These are considered the primary sections - there are no meetings times for these sections. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Then register for a lab section (BIOL 140 sec 1XX) based on the term that you want that also fits your timetable. If there is no room in the lab section you want, register into another section if one is available. If waitlists are available register onto the waitlist for that section (waitlists will not be released until all sections are full). If there is no room on the waitlist, try another waitlist section.        
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>BIOL 200 is a core second-year required course needed by many students. As the demand for this course is high, registration for the course can be challenging. <i>Please read through this information very carefully so that you register for the course correctly!</i></p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Students need to register in all 3 activity types (Lecture, Laboratory and Tutorial) to complete registration.
      </li>
      <li>
        To begin, you must register in BIOL200-000 (the “primary section”). You cannot access any of the other components of the course (lectures, lecture waitlists or tutorials) until you get a seat in the 000 section.  
        <ul>
          <li>
            BIOL 200 uses a staggered seat release so about 1/3 of the seats per section per day will be released during the week of 2nd year registration as stated <a href="https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/main?pname=subjarea&tname=subjareas&req=3&dept=BIOL&course=200">here</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you successfully register into BIOL 200 000, but all lecture sections are full (ex. BIOL 200 101) or the sections that have space don’t work with your timetable, register onto a waitlist (BIOL 200 1W2) that works with your timetable. You can only register onto one of these specific waitlists if you’ve already registered for BIOL 200 000.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once the 000 section is full, it will be blocked, and a waitlist for 000 will be opened. Its number is BIOL200-0W0 and you should register for the waitlist.
          </li>
          <li>
            Biology <strong>never</strong> registers more students in 000 than they have seats for in lecture/ tutorial. Lecture and tutorial sections sometimes look like they have seats because students who are already in 000 have not completed their registration.            
          </li>
        </ul>       
      </li>
      <li>
        Anyone registering for BIOL 200 with any kind of transfer credit, or an equivalency that is not listed in the UBC Course Schedule, will receive a notification that they do not have the pre-requisites. If you are sure you have the pre-requisites, please disregard that message. 
        <ul>
          <li>The registration system is not able to assess non-traditional credits, so it may send you a notification in error; however, Biology has set up the course so that the system <strong>cannot block you from registering in BIOL200 for that reason</strong>. If you are blocked from registration, it will be because the course is full/blocked, you are trying to register in a lecture/ tutorial without being registered in 000, or there is some kind of conflict in your timetable. Please read your warning message carefully and completely, and look to see if the 0W0 waitlist has been opened.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Biology works hard to help everyone get where they want to be in BIOL200, but sometimes it takes a while. Registration in BIOL200 continues to change (sometimes dramatically) right up to the <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/registration/course-change-dates">add/drop deadline</a> in September, so even if it’s challenging at first, please keep trying! Patience and perseverance generally pay off with BIOL200.</li>
      <li>The Biology Department posts <a href="https://ubc-biol200-registration.tumblr.com/">regular updates</a> related to BIOL 200 registration during the registration period. Please check there first. </li>
      <li>Do not contact the course instructors regarding registration issues. For other issues please check <a href="https://courses.students.ubc.ca/cs/main?pname=subjarea&tname=subjareas&req=3&dept=BIOL&course=200">here</a> for contact details.</li>

    </p>
    <p>
      However, if you have generic transfer credits (ex. CHEM 121 and CHEM 1st(4) or CHEM 1st(6 or 8) you’ll need to waitlist for CHEM 233.

   [accordion title="I received credit that looks something like this: PHIL 2<sup>nd</sup> (3) – what does that mean, and how does it apply to my degree? "]
    <p>This is a type of transfer credit called <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=2,25,75,0">unassigned credit</a>. Unassigned credit may be granted when course-to-course equivalency cannot be established. The name “PHIL” indicates which course code the course is most equivalent to at UBC (in this case, Philosophy). The “2nd” indicates what year level the credit has been assigned (in this case, it is a second year or 200-level equivalent course). The number in parentheses (3) indicates how many transfer credits you have been awarded for that course.

   [accordion title="Do I have to take LFS 100 as a transfer student?"]
    <p>If you are a transfer student into LFS, you are not required to take LFS 100 001. However, you must complete an exemption quiz in order to waive this requirement – therefore please register for LFS 100 XMT when you register for courses in June/July. You must be registered in LFS 100 XMT to receive information about the LFS 100 Exemption Quiz. An "exemption" is not the same as "credit". You will still need to complete the university's required number of credits for the degree program you are pursuing. Therefore, you may need to make up this 1 credit to meet your graduation requirements. </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="What is the LFS 100 exemption quiz and when do I need to take it by?"]
    <ul>
      <li>
        The LFS 100 exemption quiz is an exam that transfer students are eligible to complete so that they don’t need to actually take LFS 100 (a course that is designed for first-year students new to university life). Transfer students who are eligible to take this exam must register for LFS 100 XMT during their registration period, and will then be sent instructions in August of how to complete the exam online. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you would rather attend LFS 100 001 even if you are eligible for the exemption quiz, you may do so and register for a regular section of LFS 100. 
      </li>
      <li>
        PLEASE NOTE: If you are required to maintain a minimum credit load this year for reasons such as student loans, student housing, awards/scholarships, etc., please consider your eligibility requirements before electing to take the LFS 100 exemption quiz. If you are unsure if you meet these requirements please contact <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/student-services/#connect">LFS Student Services</a>. International students with student loan funding are encouraged to contact Student Services regarding the LFS 100 Exemption Quiz.

   [accordion title="I transferred to and LFS program from another program at UBC – how many of my credits can be applied to my LFS degree?"]
    <p>
