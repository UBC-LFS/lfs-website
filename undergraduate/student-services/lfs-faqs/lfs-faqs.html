   [accordion title="How do I register for classes and when do I register for them?"]
    <p>
      You can find more information about this <a href="http://www.landfood.ubc.ca/student-services/registration-program-info/">here</a>. Once you’ve reviewed this information, if you still have questions about registering for courses, please contact LFS Student Services.

   [accordion title="How do I meet the Faculty’s Communication Requirement?"]
    <p>You can find more information about this requirement <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,795,875">here</a>. </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="Why is this course blocked from registration? There is an available seat, but I can’t register into the course I need."]
    <p>If a course is blocked from registration, it usually means that there is a waitlist for the course. Check to see if there is a waitlist available, and if there’s a waitlist, please register onto it. If the waitlist is full, please keep checking to see if space on the waitlist becomes available (as you won’t be able to register into the course, as it’s blocked, even if you see spots available). It’s a good idea to check for space as frequently as possible (ex. every hour, every few hours). </p>
    <p>If there is no waitlist available, check to see if there is a note on the UBC Course Schedule regarding why that particular course/section is blocked. If there is no note, the course may be full at that time.</p>
    <p>Some courses are blocked because they require special approval by your Program Advisor - so you won’t be able to register into the course yourself. Some examples of these types of courses are: Directed Studies, Career Internship, Undergrad Thesis/Essay, etc. Please review this website for more information.</p>

   [accordion title="What courses do I need to take?"]

   [accordion title="How many courses should I take this year/per term?"]
    <p>
      That decision is up to you as it depends on the student. How many courses do you want to take each term? Do you have other commitments outside of school such as work or volunteering? Most students take 9-15 credits per term, so this would be 3-5 courses maximum. Please note, if you end up taking a reduced course load, this may delay your graduation, but students can try and catch up on course work over the summer (if the courses are offered). 
    </p>
    <p>
      We recommend that students prioritize taking core/required courses during the Winter Sessions. Students can more easily defer some electives or courses that are traditionally offered in summer sessions the following summer. Please be aware of course prerequisites (ensure you are meeting them or going through your courses in a general sequential order) and <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,795,1645">Year Promotion</a> requirements for the following year – there may be some courses that are best taken in the Winter Session and not deferred to the summer! 
    </p>
    <p>
      Our Faculty does not have a definition for “full-time” or “part-time” status, as we do not require students to take a minimum number of courses per year i.e. if you want to take 1 course per term, that’s fine! It will just take you longer to complete your degree. Having said that, students need to ensure they meet the minimum credit requirements for:    
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      	On campus student housing (residence) 
      </li>
      <li>
      	Maintaining your eligibility for any current or future scholarships, funding and/or student loans. (Please refer to your <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/enrolment-services-professionals-esp">Enrolment Services Professional</a> for more information). 
      </li>

      	<a href="https://students.ubc.ca/international-student-guide">Immigration requirements</a> (study permit requirements and requirements to work on and off-campus).        
      </li>
    </ul>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="I’m getting a warning that says I have exceeded my credit limit – why?"]
    <p>
      All students are allowed to take a maximum of 32-33 credits a year, which is ~5 courses a term. For more information, please read the following <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,795,1646">page</a>. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact LFS Student Services. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note, there is a pre-set limit to the number of credits you’re allowed to take per term – waitlists contribute to your overall credit requirement. 
    </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="How do I know if I’m eligible to take a course? What are the steps to figure this out?"]
    <p>
      Check to see if you meet the prerequisites for the course. If you don’t meet the prerequisites, you aren’t eligible to take the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      Check to see what the seat restrictions are (please review other FAQ’s for more information). 
    </p>
    <p>
      If you meet the prerequisites/remaining seat restrictions for the course and there is still space available, you should be able to register for it.    
    </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="The course I want says it is “restricted”. What does that mean?!"]
    <p>
      If a section says “restricted” beside it on the UBC Course Schedule, it does not mean it is restricted to you (or not for you), specifically. It means that only restricted seats are available. Those restricted seats are allocated to various groups of students which could include year standing, Faculty (LFS, Science, etc.), a specific program (must be in BSFN) or grade (ex. must have 75% or above to take this course). In some cases a portion of the seats are reserved so that students who require this course to complete their program can register. In other cases, an entire course is restricted because students can only take it if they are in a specific program.
    </p>
    <p>
      You need to look at what the restricted seats are for each course and each section of a course that you want to take to see if you meet them, as they can vary between sections, and they can also change throughout the day during registration. If you meet the seat restrictions and you meet the prerequisites for the course, and there is space available, you should be able to register for the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there are general seats available (seats that don’t have any restrictions on them, other than the course prerequisites), then any student should be able to register for those seats.
    </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="What is the difference between a prerequisite requirement and a seat restriction?"]
    <p>
      A prerequisite is a course that you need to have completed <i>prior</i> to registering for the selected course. If you don’t meet the prerequisite for a course, you are not eligible to take it.
    </p>
    <p>
      For information on what a seat restriction is, please review other FAQ’s for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Students need to meet the prerequisites for a course and meet the seat restrictions, to be eligible to take a course.
    </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="When I test my registration, I get warnings saying I do not meet prerequisites…but I do!"]
    <p>
      With worklists, you can “test” your registration prior to your registration date/time. Many courses will have prerequisites and say “Restricted” on the UBC Course Schedule. For more information about this, please review please review other FAQ’s for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is the warning you’re seeing in yellow or red? 
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
      	If it’s in yellow, it’s simply just a warning to remind students to check that they are indeed eligible for the course. If you do have the prerequisites, you can ignore the error – when your date/time opens, you should be able to register yourself into the course, seats permitting. There is no need to contact the Faculty or department advisor regarding registration, despite the error message above.
      </li>
      <li>
      	If it’s in red, you don’t meet the course restrictions/prerequisites and you will not be able to register yourself into the course. If you feel this is an error and you do actually meet the prerequisites for a course (via transfer credits, etc.), please try and register onto a corresponding waitlist first and then contact LFS Student Services for additional help/questions.        
      </li>
    </ul>
    
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="What is the difference between a prerequisite and a corequisite?"]
    <p>
      A prerequisite is a course that the student must have completed <i>prior</i> to registering for the selected course.
    </p>
    <p>
      A corequisite is a course that the student must take prior to OR concurrently with the selected course. The UBC Course Schedule and some course descriptions show prerequisite/corequisite requirements where applicable.
    </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="LPI: what is it and do I need to take it?"]
    <p>
      The <a href="">Language Proficiency Index (LPI)</a> exam assesses a student’s readiness to pursue academic work in critical reading and writing at a university level.  This is different than the <a href="http://you.ubc.ca/applying-ubc/english-language-competency/">English Language competency requirement </a>(IELTS or TOEFL).
    </p>
    <p>
      The LPI exam can be used to meet the <a href="https://english.ubc.ca/first-year-english/frequently-asked-questions-faq/#1">First-Year English Course Entry Requirements</a>, if you do not meet any of the other requirements (e.g. a certain grade in English 11 or 12). 
    </p>
    <p>
      Please check to see if you meet the <a href="https://english.ubc.ca/first-year-english/frequently-asked-questions-faq/#1">First-Year English Course Entry Requirements</a> and if you don’t, you will need to take the LPI. Please pay attention to the deadlines listed under #4 on the website above, which outlines when you need to complete the LPI exam by, to remain registered in LFS 150 or ENGL 112. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Please review the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,795,875">UBC Academic Calendar</a> for more information. If you still have questions about the LPI requirement, please contact LFS Student Services directly.

   [accordion title="Do I have to take LFS 100 as a transfer student?"]
    <p>If you are a transfer student into LFS, you are not required to take LFS 100 001. However, you must complete an exemption quiz in order to waive this requirement – therefore please register for LFS 100 XMT when you register for courses in June/July. You must be registered in LFS 100 XMT to receive information about the LFS 100 Exemption Quiz. An "exemption" is not the same as "credit". You will still need to complete the university's required number of credits for the degree program you are pursuing. Therefore, you may need to make up this 1 credit to meet your graduation requirements. </p>
   [/accordion]
   [accordion title="What is the LFS 100 exemption quiz and when do I need to take it by?"]
    <ul>
      <li>
        The LFS 100 exemption quiz is an exam that transfer students are eligible to complete so that they don’t need to actually take LFS 100 (a course that is designed for first-year students new to university life). Transfer students who are eligible to take this exam must register for LFS 100 XMT during their registration period, and will then be sent instructions in August of how to complete the exam online. 
      </li>
      <li>
        If you would rather attend LFS 100 001 even if you are eligible for the exemption quiz, you may do so and register for a regular section of LFS 100. 
      </li>
      <li>
        PLEASE NOTE: If you are required to maintain a minimum credit load this year for reasons such as student loans, student housing, awards/scholarships, etc., please consider your eligibility requirements before electing to take the LFS 100 exemption quiz. If you are unsure if you meet these requirements please contact <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/student-services/#connect">LFS Student Services</a>. International students with student loan funding are encouraged to contact Student Services regarding the LFS 100 Exemption Quiz.
