  <h3>How LFS programs connect with Indigenous issues</h3>
  <p>Undergraduate programs in the Faculty of Land and Food Systems (LFS) are separated into three streams with individual majors
    in each of those streams. The three streams are:
    <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/undergraduate/food-nutrition-and-health/">Food, Nutrition, and Health</a>;
    <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/undergraduate/applied-biology/">Applied Biology</a>; and
    <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/undergraduate/global-resource-systems/">Global Resource Systems</a>.</p>
  <p>Each of these streams in our faculty share a core series of courses which highlights how each component of the food system
    is connected by broader issues. At LFS, we recognize the emergent issues within Indigenous communities as they relate
    to the food system. These issues include: food security; nutrition; land management; fisheries, wildlife and range management;
    and food preservation and production. The Faculty of Land and Food Systems is well suited to position students to address
    these issues within their particular cultural contexts. The Faculty of Land and Food Systems maintains active research
    partnerships with Canadian and global Indigenous communities; we offer courses focusing on emergent Indigenous issues;
    and we have facilities, such as the
    <a href="http://ubcfarm.ubc.ca/">UBC Farm</a>, which promote Indigenous space and initiatives on campus. As a faculty, we are committed to expanding education
    and research that is relevant to Indigenous communities in Canada and around the globe.</p>
