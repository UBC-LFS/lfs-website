    <h3 class="intro">The LFS Student Services team provides academic advising and support for all undergraduate students in a safe, welcoming
        and respectful environment. Through drop-in and booked advising appointments, we'll help you navigate your academic
        and non-academic journey at UBC and in LFS, answer your questions, and connect you with resources and support services
        across campus. From orientation to graduation, we work together with campus partners, your LFS Undergraduate Society
        (LFS|US) and other LFS student groups to put on events and programming to support your academic success — and to
        help you have some fun while you're here! When things feel a little intense, when you want to celebrate your successes,
        or even if you just want to grab a snack or work on the Student Services puzzle, we encourage you to come and see
        us.

    <h2>Information for LFS faculty</h2>
    <p>We've compiled some key information for LFS faculty members here. Anything you can't find an answer to, give us a call
        or drop in at our office.</p>
    [accordions collapsible=true active=false] [accordion title="Support for students"]
    <p> Faculty members are in a unique position in that you see students on a regular basis and can often observe changes in
        behaviour, attendance or academics that indicate a student may be experiencing challenges outside the classroom (illness,
        personal challenges, family tragedy etc.). If you have concerns about a student's wellbeing, please take the time
        to educate yourself about
        <a href="https://facultystaff.students.ubc.ca/assisting-students-distress">assisting students in distress</a>, and
        <a href="mailto:students@landfood.ubc.ca">notify</a> LFS Student Services in any cases where you feel our support would be beneficial. We can often liaise
        with other resources and support services on campus to ensure the student in question is receiving the support they
        need, and we're instrumental in advising students on how to manage their academic portfolio in the face of challenges.
        We're also available to provide guidance and support for you as well as your students, and encourage you to reach
        out to us with any questions or concerns.
    </p>
    <p> We strongly encourage all faculty to retain a copy of the
        <a href="https://facultystaff.students.ubc.ca/sites/facultystaff.students.ubc.ca/files/green-folder-sexual-assault-insert.pdf">Green Folder</a>, the mental health and wellbeing resource guide to assisting students in distress, provided by our
        colleagues in UBC Student Development and Services. If you would like a hard copy, please contact
        <a href="mailto:students@landfood.ubc.ca">LFS Student Services</a> to request one.
    </p>
    [/accordion] [accordion title="Grade submission deadlines"]
    <p>As per the
        <a href="https://facultystaff.students.ubc.ca/files/FSCUserGuide.pdf">FSC (Faculty Service Centre) User Guide</a>, final grades are due seven business days from the exam date (five business
        days from the exam date, if the exam is written on the last two days of the exam period). For directed studies, undergraduate
        thesis and essay courses, we kindly ask that instructors use the
        <a href="https://senate.ubc.ca/vancouver/termdates">end-of-term dates</a> for grade submission deadlines. We appreciate your commitment to meeting these deadlines, as
        late submissions can prevent students from meeting eligibility requirements for year promotion, scholarships, academic
        standing evaluations, graduation or other critical stages of their academic progression. If you have concerns about
        meeting these deadlines, please notify
        <a href="mailto:students@landfood.ubc.ca">LFS Student Services</a> so that we can work together to ensure students' records are up to date, and that any impacts
        to their progress are mitigated.
    </p>
    [/accordion] [accordion title="Registration, exam &amp; scheduling inquiries"]
    <p>We work together with the associate dean as well as the academic and program directors to ensure the Summer and Winter
        schedules are created, published and maintained, and also to collect and submit requests for final exams. Should
        you have any questions about registration, exams or scheduling, please direct your inquiries as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Course and student record management: For questions regarding registration of students in your courses (exceptions
            to prerequisites, management of wait lists, etc.), submitting change-of-grade requests (via email or the Change
            of Grade form via the FSC), please email
            <a href="mailto:students@landfood.ubc.ca">students@landfood.ubc.ca</a>.
        </li>
        <li>Course and exam administration: For questions about the scheduling details of your courses (terms, days, times, locations,
