  <h3>Once you've been admitted</h3>
  <p>Once you've received your offer of admission, you might be wondering,
    <i>What now?</i> Here's a helpful
    <a href="http://you.ubc.ca/applying-ubc/admitted/">checklist</a> with details about what to do before you come. From planning your finances to finding a place to live and
    registering for courses, this list positions you for success!</p>
  <h3>Academics</h3>
  <p>In your first year, you will register in your foundational science courses (first-year chemistry, biology, math and physics).
    You'll also take LFS 100, a first-year seminar course, with all the other first-year students in the Faculty. Your schedule
    will be full with these start-up courses, so there really isn't room for electives (courses you get to choose yourself)
    in first year. It's a fairly structured journey this year, but your upper-level courses in future years will draw on
    theories and concepts from these courses. You are laying the foundation for your academic future!</p>
  <p>If you want to travel with a familiar group of classmates throughout your first year, check out our
    <a href="http://landone.ubc.ca/">Land One program</a> option, available only to first-year students on a competitive basis. Land One gathers a group of
    students from LFS and from the Faculty of Forestry into a single cohort, where you'll take your first-year classes together
    in an integrated course suite. Land One offers a collaborative environment, with plenty of opportunity for hands-on learning
    through field trips and experiential work. As a bonus? Studies show that students in cohorts tend to do better in the
    later years of their degree.
    <a href="http://landone.ubc.ca/">Check it out</a> — and be sure to apply by the deadline.</p>
  <p>Be sure to review your program options, and learn about registration processes and timelines. Some courses are only offered
    at specific times or in specific terms, so take the time to read through the registration info
    <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/student-services/registration-program-info/">here</a> and plan ahead! The more work you do up front, the better.</p>
  <h3>Beyond the classroom</h3>
  <p>Depending on where you're coming to UBC from, you may be able to attend a UBC welcome event in your area in the spring.
    We even host a UBC Welcomes You event
    <a href="http://you.ubc.ca/tours-info-sessions/campus-tours-events/on-campus-events/">on campus</a> where you can meet and ask questions of LFS students, staff and faculty to set yourself up for success.
    To see a complete list of spring events in other Canadian and international locales, visit the list here.</p>
  <p>If you're in or near Vancouver, you may want to attend a UBC–Vancouver campus tour. You'll be able to meet UBC students,
    get to know our beautiful campus and start to get comfortable navigating your new "home."</p>
  <p>Here's a quick tip that'll make your life a lot easier: Know the name of your Faculty (Land and Food Systems) and your
    degree program (e.g. Bachelor of Science in Food, Nutrition and Health; Bachelor of Science in Applied Biology; or Bachelor
    of Global Resource Systems).</p>
  <p>And finally, there's no better way to meet new people, get comfortable at UBC and feel prepared for your first year than
    by attending the Jump Start and Imagine <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/new-to-ubc/orientations">orientation programs</a>! Learn more here.</p>

  <p>The adjustment to the academic pace and rigour of UBC from high school or another post-secondary institution can be a tough
    one, so start yourself off on the right foot. Learn to be your own advocate, and be proactive in seeking and making use
    of available resources and supports.</p>
  <h3>To ensure you can
    <i style="font-size: inherit;">pasta</i> all of your courses...</h3>
  <p>Go to class! It may sound like an obvious piece of advice, but if you're living away from home for the first time, it can
    be easy to miss class when someone isn't waking you up and checking in on you. Remember: you're in the driver's seat
    of your own success now. If you're not showing up . . . you're not showing up.</p>
  <p>You may find your academic identity is challenged in first year. What worked for you in the past may not be what works
    for you in university. It's important for you to recognize when something isn't working and adjust your approach. Don't
    be afraid to ask for help: from study habits to time management and stress reduction, there is a ton of help for you
    in UBC's
    <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/academic-success">academic support resources</a>.</p>
  <p>Don't be afraid to ask your professors when you're unsure about concepts in class. Many instructors hold office hours where
    you can visit to ask questions and get clarity on the course. Your professors are people too, and you shouldn't feel
    intimidated to approach them. And here's a tip: profs get an awful lot of email. So when you've got a question or something
    to share, instead of firing off an impersonal electronic message, make use of those office hours. Connecting face-to-face
    is a much more effective way to build your network, anyway.</p>
  <p>Academic advisors in LFS Student Services are also available to help you talk through your challenges and navigate options
    to help you succeed. You can book an appointment in advance or just drop in during our office hours to chat. You can
    also email your questions or give us a call! Here's how to
    <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/student-services/#connect">find us</a>.</p>
  <h3>Establish some
    <i style="font-size: inherit;">roots</i>
  </h3>
  <p>Get to know your faculty and campus by getting involved outside your classes. You don't want to overload yourself in first
    year, but studies show that students who participate in university life do better overall. Getting involved with things
    that bring you joy is a great way to meet new people who share your interests, or to try something new and challenge
    yourself! University is a time of exploration, so get out there and see where you might like to plant some seeds.</p>
  <p>You'll meet fellow students and get to know more about the Faculty of Land and Food Systems by coming out to a
    <a href="https://www.lfsus.landfood.ubc.ca/wnd">
      Wednesday Night Dinner
    </a>, attending an
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lfs.aceteam/">ACE Team event</a>
    or grabbing a bite at the student-run
    <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/agora/">Agora Cafe</a> in the basement of the MacMillan Building. Or, check out
    <a href="https://www.ams.ubc.ca/clubs/joining-a-club/clubs-days/">AMS Clubs Days</a> in the early part of the term to see which of <a href="https://www.campusvibe.ca/campusvibe/groups/cea260f5-8aab-4e11-bccf-fe4a846e62dc#policygroup=6c013575-13dd-48b2-89de-3f7584506b70">UBC's 300+ clubs</a> may be of interest to you. There's
    plenty more information about how to get involved on our
    <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/undergraduate/campus/">Campus page</a>.</p>
  <p>Stay in touch with your Orientation leader throughout Term 1 by participating in the exciting social events they'll plan
    for you. This helps you develop a relationship with someone who's familiar with life at UBC and in LFS — and who's got
    great leadership skills. You'll also be nurturing the connections you made with other students during Jump Start and
    Imagine.
  </p>
  <p>Read the weekly Newslettuce email that LFS Student Services sends you. You'll keep on top of important dates and be aware
    of opportunities and events that you will want to take advantage of. Similarly, read your weekly UBCfyi email for campus-wide
    updates and news, and visit
    <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/">students.ubc.ca</a> for links to helpful resources and services.</p>

  <p>We hope that your first term of your first year was a resounding success! You may want to connect with an academic advisor
    in LFS Student Services to review your academic performance from Term 1 and make changes to your Term 2 schedule.</p>
  <p>Reflect on your experiences in Term 1. How did things go academically? How did your experiences feel on a personal level?</p>
  <p>Always make time for a wellness check-in. Take responsibility for staying on top of your emotional and mental health by
    exploring and making use of the resources available
    <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/health-wellness">here</a>.</p>
  <h3>To ensure you can
    <i style="font-size: inherit;">pasta</i> all of your courses...</h3>
  <p>If you haven't done so already, it's time to familiarize yourself with the Faculty's annual academic evaluation process
    and year promotion requirements. We've got all the necessary information

  <p>Do you plan on taking courses in the Summer Session (May to August)? Most students don't; they take a break over the summer
