    <h2>Community-Based Experiential Learning</h2>
    <p>Experiential learning is a core philosophy in our faculty. Applying your knowledge in practical, real-world settings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            accelerates your learning;
        </li>
        <li>
            teaches you effective problem-solving skills;
        </li>
        <li>
            bridges the gap between theory and practice;
        </li>
        <li>
            shapes your mindset;
        </li>
        <li>
            delivers high return on your investment; and
        </li>
        <li>
            makes your learning very, very personalized.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        As an added bonus, you'll be building relationships within the community while you're gaining all that professional experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        Select LFS courses, including the LFS core series, involve community-based experiential learning (CBEL). Through CBEL, you
        can partner with not-for-profit organizations, businesses and/or public schools on projects that are driven by community
        priorities. By taking part in these experiences, you'll be enriching your grasp of classroom learning through actually
        applying it, investing your personal energy to make a positive difference, and challenging yourself in new learning
        environments to better understand what kind of work you’d like to pursue.

    <p>The LFS core series courses give you the opportunity to acquire and apply the knowledge, tools and expertise required
        to meaningfully move the needle on food security and sustainability initiatives. You will incorporate both academic
        and community perspectives as you apply your knowledge in an environmentally, socially and economically sustainable
        manner to community food-security challenges. Community-based experiential learning is a key component of the LFS
        core series, and all undergraduate students take part. You can learn more about the core series here.</p>
    <p>If there's a CBEL component in a given course, your instructor will guide you. In CBEL courses, you'll have the opportunity
        to help advance the priorities of community-based organizations working to improve the social and cultural positions
        of certain segments of society, practice and develop your reflective and critical thinking skills, and interpret
        your theoretical knowledge in a way that's useful to community partners — all of which contribute to a stronger foundation
        for employability upon graduation.</p>
    <p>Both local and international community placements are available for CBEL courses.</p>

    <p>If you're unsure about what opportunities will best help you meet your goals, we encourage you to visit LFS Student Services
        to meet with our student engagement officer, our career strategist, or an academic advisor (or all three!). We'll
        help you narrow down your choices and share what we know about how to reach beyond campus to build your network.</p>
