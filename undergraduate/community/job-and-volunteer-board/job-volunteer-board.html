  <h2>Co-op for LFS Students</h2>
  <h3>For Employers</h3>
  <p>
    Are you an employer who's interested in hiring motivated, energetic students to help your organization accomplish its goals?
    Are you intent on helping to shape, inspire and mentor the next generation of problem-solvers? LFS students are encouraged
    to participate in co-op learning as much as possible. Our students bring fresh ideas, energy and knowledge to your organization
    — and they'll help you get to where you want to go. Our students have acquired the academic knowledge and professional
    skills to be effective in work experiences, and are ready to apply those skills in the working world. They offer tremendous
    value to your organization. UBC connects over 4000 students with co-op placements every year, making it the largest program
    offered at any post-secondary institution in British Columbia. We've definitely got the expertise to assist in finding
    the right person to complement your mission and boost your organizational efficacy!
  </p>
  <p>
    Faculty of Land and Food Systems student placements are completed through the UBC Science Co-op program. To bring a Land
    and Food Systems student on board for a co-operative work experience, please contact our co-op coordinator,
    <a href="mailto:cmckinnon@sciencecoop.ubc.ca">Chris McKinnon</a>.
  </p>
  <h3>For Students</h3>
  <p>
    The value of co-op work experiences can't be overstated. If you're an LFS student, there's a whole world of work experience
    out there, just waiting for you to jump in! Are you focused on food-related studies? You can gain valuable on-the-ground
    experience in food chemistry and other lab-related environments through a diverse set of organizations that will prepare
    you to enter the many various facets of food science after graduation. And if food isn’t your thing? LFS can dial you
    in to a range of co-op experiences including clinical research, government, field, academia, plant and soil research,
    wet lab, health research and loads more! All of this work experience adds up to an excellent work-relevant foundation
    for your entry into the career sector after graduation.
  </p>
  <p>
    Co-op welcomes applications from students in all LFS streams (i.e. FNH, Applied Biology and GRS alike). Our co-op program
    runs through UBC Science Co-op. Check out the LFS program
    <a href="https://sciencecoop.ubc.ca/prospective/apply/land">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p> Here's a snapshot of where LFS co-op students have worked in previous years: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Food Science</strong> — quality control co-op at Pacific Blends; food safety co-op at Redpath Foods
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Applied Biology</strong> — aquatic lab technician co-op at the Department of Fisheries and Oceans; cropping systems
      research assistant co-op at Agri-Food Canada
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Food, Nutrition and Health</strong> — People, Plants and Homes program assistant co-op at BC Housing; quality control
      microbiology co-op at and Factors Group
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Nutritional Sciences</strong> — healthy environments and consumer safety co-op at Health Canada; clinical research
      assistant co-op at St. Paul’s Hospital
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Global Resource Systems</strong> — land use inventory technician co-op at BC Ministry of Agriculture; environment department
      co-op at Vancouver International Airport
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Regardless of what type of experience you acquire during your co-op term, UBC's long history of offering co-ops shows that
    co-op graduates tend be far greater experienced and skilled when compared to those who don't engage in co-operative work
    experiences. Co-op work terms offer you a competitive advantage in gaining employment after graduation, or in carrying
    you further toward your post-graduate study aspirations.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're interested in exploring a variety of experiences and are keen on adding valuable skill sets to your resume, we
    encourage you to apply! Learn more about UBC Science Co-op
