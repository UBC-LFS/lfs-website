    <h3>International in scope and interdisciplinary in nature, UBC's Global Resource Systems program is a degree you design
        for yourself, centered on local and international resource issues. You will select a region of the world to focus
        on, as well as a resource discipline within the Faculty of Land and Food Systems. With these as your focal point,
        you will develop a richly layered understanding of international resource issues by taking courses across the arts,
        sciences and social sciences. You will explore complex resource problems. You will travel to another country. You
        will graduate prepared to participate on the international stage, bringing your insight and education to bear on
        some of the world's most multilayered resource-driven problems.</h3>

        <h2>Majors Offered</h2>
        <h3>Global Resource Systems (GRS) is a major in itself â€” and it's one you design entirely
            <i>for</i> yourself. Find out more about what GRS involves, some courses you might take as part of your studies,
            and career possibilities for when you graduate. We've also got links to alumni bios, where you can read about
            how LFS grads are using their Global Resource Systems degree in their careers.</h3>

                                    (GRS) program at UBC offers exactly that kind of learning path. Combining arts and science
                                    courses, GRS gives you the flexibility to build your own bachelor of science around a)
                                    a region of the world and b) a resource discipline from within the Faculty of Land and
                                    Food Systems.
