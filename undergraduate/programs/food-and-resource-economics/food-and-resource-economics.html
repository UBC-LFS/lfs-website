    <h3 class="intro">Just like the web of life you learned about in grade school, where the reverberations of each organism's actions are felt by the others sharing the same web, Earth's food and resource systems are intricately connected. As our global population expands — and as our demands on the planet's resources and food supply increases — there's a pressing need for thinkers who can solve real problems in the food and resource sectors. UBC's Food and Resource Economics program develops those thinkers.</h3>

    <h2> What you need to know </h2>
    [tabs] [tab title="Why Study Food and Resource Economics at UBC?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Highly flexible so that you can focus on your area of greatest interest, the Food and Resource Economics degree (FRE) lets you home in on the global issues you think matter the most, whether they're in trade, the environment or the management of resources in the food industry. Through preparation in critical and analytical skills, experiential learning, and opportunities to build your competencies through practicums or in overseas study, this program primes you for employment in the expanding field of food and resource economics, or prepares you to take your studies to the next level.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>In Food and Resource Economics (FRE), you'll work with peers, profs and professionals to understand and critically analyze a range of economic issues in food supply chains, including the environmental and resource-related impacts of food production. You'll round out a solid base in economics, business, math and empirical methods with restricted electives (primarily in economics and business) and unrestricted electives, focusing your degree toward the area of food and resource economics that interests you most.</p>
      <p>In FRE, you can specialize in one of the following three topic areas:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
            Food Markets and Trade
          </li>
          <li>
            Land, Resources and Environment
          </li>
          <li>
            Food and Resource Management
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Or you can mix-and-match between them. If you're primarily interested in agribusiness and resource management, we suggest you choose the Food and Resource Management stream, or even look into the Master of Management Dual Degree program option. Upon completion of the FRE program, you'll be well suited to pursue graduate studies in UBC's Master of Food and Resource Economics, the School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at UBC, or a variety of applied economics MSc programs outside of UBC.</p>
      <p>In Food and Resource Economics, you will take a combination of degree requirements (required of all students) and restricted electives (courses selected from a broad list of approved electives). You'll also be able to take a number of unrestricted electives (courses you get to pick yourself).</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Sample Courses"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In addition to the LFS core series, you will take a broad cross-section of science, mathematics and economics courses throughout your program. Some exciting courses you can look forward to include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
              FRE 306: Introduction to Global Food Markets
            </li>
            <li>
              ECON 234: Wealth and Poverty of Nations
            </li>
            <li>

        <h3>Minors</h3>
        <p>You may choose to supplement your Food and Resource Economics major with a minor, which involves taking courses in a subject area outside of your specialization. As an FRE student, you're eligible to apply for a <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/student-services/registration-program-info/#choosing-a-minor">here</a>
        </p>
        <!-- <h3>Dual Degree with Master of Management</h3>
        <p>If you are interested in complementing your LFS degree with a strong foundation in management, consider applying for the Bachelor of Science (Applied Biology) – Master of Management Dual Degree. Please note: admission to this program is primarily available to students coming directly out of high school. Depending on enrolment, the UBC Sauder School of Business may release a limited number of spaces on a competitive basis to students who are going into their third year at UBC (or those who are transferring to UBC for their third year). For more details about this dual-degree program option and for information about how to apply, please see the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,199,961,0#21418">Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration</a> section of the UBC Academic Calendar.</p> -->

    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>If you are a current APBI student interested in the Applied Animal Biology major, you will be prompted to select your specialization through your Student Service Centre (SSC) when registering for second year. This major is not competitive. (You'll only need to formally apply if you are interested in the Honours program, which is competitive.)</p>
        <p>If you are a high school, college or university student and you want to major in Applied Animal Biology at UBC, you should apply for the Bachelor of Science in Applied Biology. You can learn more <a href="http://you.ubc.ca/applying-ubc/">here</a>.</p>
