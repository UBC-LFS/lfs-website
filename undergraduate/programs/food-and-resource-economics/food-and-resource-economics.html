    <h3 class="intro">Just like the web of life you learned about in grade school, where the reverberations of each organism's actions are felt by the others sharing the same web, Earth's food and resource systems are intricately connected. As our global population expands — and as our demands on the planet's resources and food supply increases — there's a pressing need for thinkers who can solve real problems in the food and resource sectors. UBC's Food and Resource Economics program develops those thinkers.</h3>

    <h2> What You Need to Know </h2>
    [tabs] [tab title="Why Study Food and Resource Economics at UBC?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Highly flexible so that you can focus on your area of greatest interest, the Food and Resource Economics degree (FRE) lets you home in on the global issues you think matter the most, whether they're in trade, the environment or the management of resources in the food industry. Through preparation in critical and analytical skills, experiential learning, and opportunities to build your competencies through practicums or in overseas study, this program primes you for employment in the expanding field of food and resource economics, or prepares you to take your studies to the next level.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>In Food and Resource Economics (FRE), you'll work with peers, profs and professionals to understand and critically analyze a range of economic and management issues in food supply chains, including the environmental and resource-related impacts of food production. You'll round out a solid base in economics, business, math and empirical methods with restricted electives (primarily in economics and business) and unrestricted electives, focusing your degree toward the area of food and resource economics that interests you most.</p>
      <p>In FRE, you can specialize in one of the following three topic areas:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
            Food Markets and Trade
          </li>
          <li>
            Land, Resources and Environment
          </li>
          <li>
            Food and Resource Management
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can also mix and match between them. If you're primarily interested in agribusiness and resource management, we suggest you choose the Food and Resource Management stream, or even look into the Master of Management Dual Degree program option. Upon completion of the FRE program, you'll be well suited to pursue graduate studies in UBC's <a href="http://mfre.landfood.ubc.ca/">Master of Food and Resource Economics</a>, the <a href="https://policyschool.ubc.ca/?login">School of Public Policy and Global Affairs at UBC</a>, or a variety of applied economics MSc programs outside of UBC.</p>
      <p>In Food and Resource Economics, you will take a combination of degree requirements (required of all students) and restricted electives (courses selected from a broad list of approved electives). You'll also be able to take a number of unrestricted electives (courses you get to pick yourself).</p>

    <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>Minors</h3>
        <p>You may choose to supplement your Food and Resource Economics major with a minor, which involves taking courses in a subject area outside of your specialization. As an FRE student, you're eligible to apply for a Minor in Arts, Science, Fermentations or Sustainable Food Systems. Read more about minors, including application timelines, right <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/student-services/registration-program-info/#choosing-a-minor">here.</a>
        </p>
        <h3>Dual Degree with Master of Management</h3>
        <p>If you’re thinking of taking your Food and Resource Economics degree to another level — or into the business arena — you may want to apply for the Bachelor of Science (Food and Resource Economics) – Master of Management Dual Degree. Please note: admission to this program is primarily available to students coming directly out of high school. Depending on enrolment, the UBC Sauder School of Business may release a limited number of spaces on a competitive basis to students who are going into their third year at UBC (or those who are transferring to UBC for their third year). Learn more about this dual-degree program option and the application process in the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,199,961,0#21418">Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration</a> section of the UBC Academic Calendar.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="How to Apply for Your Major"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>FRE is a <strong>second-year entry</strong> program, meaning you'll need to have completed 24 credits before your start date. Most students apply between December and February of their first year so they can begin the FRE program the following September. You can read more about admission requirements and timelines in the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,1013,1637">UBC Academic Calendar</a>.</p>
        <p>To help assess suitability, you will need to submit with your application a 500-word (maximum) letter of intent which addresses the following: a) why you'd like to enrol in the Food and Resource Economics program b) your professional aspirations and c) any relevant personal, volunteer or work experience you bring to the table. You can find more instructions <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/prospective/#apply">here</a>.</p>
        <p>While not required, if you are interested in applying to the Bachelor of Science in Food and Resource Economics, we strongly encourage you to follow the first-year requirements of the FRE degree.</p>
