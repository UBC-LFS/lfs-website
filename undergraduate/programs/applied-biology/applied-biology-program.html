    <h3>In UBC's Applied Biology program, you will explore the real-world application of the life sciences to the management
        of land, animals and food production. Applied Biology at the Faculty of Land and Food Systems is different from other
        biological sciences programs in that it's customizable to what you're most interested in learning. The program is
        built around practical learning experiences, critical thinking, and a systems approach that integrates technical
        knowledge with sustainability and ethics. You will graduate with the skills and knowledge to take a leadership role
        in sustainable food production and the responsible use of land, water and animals.</h3>
