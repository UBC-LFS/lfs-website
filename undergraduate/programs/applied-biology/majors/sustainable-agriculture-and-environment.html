    <h3 class="intro">This is truly where land and food systems all come together. In UBC's Sustainable Agriculture and Environment program, you'll be learning how to produce food in a way that protects our soils, water and air, how to manage biodiversity and habitat for the organisms we rely on to help us grow our food, and how to grow food in urban environments. All of which primes you for a professional career in shaping a more sustainable, food-secure future.</h3>

    <h2> What You Need to Know </h2>
    [tabs] [tab title="Why Study Sustainable Agriculture and Environment at UBC?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>It's challenging, it's hands-on, and it's practical expertise for a world that needs to figure out food solutions. In Sustainable Agriculture and Environment (SAGE), you'll apply your thinking to a range of environmental challenges, including sustainable crop production, food security, biodiversity, soil and water resources management, and climate change. You can tailor your SAE studies to focus on your particular interests, too, whether they're in agricultural production, integrated agro-ecosystem management, plant science or soil science.</p>
      <p>You'll be working toward a professional designation in pursuing this major, and as such, you are eligible to enrol as a student member of <a href="https://www.bcia.com/members/student-membership">the British Columbia Institute of Agrologists</a>. Depending on your electives, professional designations include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            Professional Agrologist with BC Institute of Agrologists (BCIA)
        </li>
        <li>
            Registered Professional Biologist (with the College of Applied Biology)
        </li>
        <li>
            Applied Biology Technician (with the College of Applied Biology)
        </li>
        <li>
            Professional Geoscientist (with Engineers and Geoscientists of BC)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In Sustainable Agriculture and Environment (SAGE), you'll study the application of soil, plant and agro-ecological sciences in enhancing sustainable food production, while protecting and strengthening the land. Talk about a hero's work! The Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at the UBC Farm is where you'll integrate real-world experience with your classroom learning, as well as in our rooftop garden and in community gardens across the city.</p>
        <p>SAE combines your core academic courses with electives that allow you to focus on your individual interests. Uncork the science behind a good bottle of wine, learn how to grow food without soil, and explore the possibilities of insects as an increasingly important source of healthy, sustainable human sustenance. You'll have opportunities to develop your research skills and build out your competencies through research experience, internships and practicums, co-ops and job placements. Upon graduation you'll be prepared for professional employment or for further academic study.</p>
        <p>In completing your Sustainable Agriculture and Environment degree, you will take a combination of degree requirements (required of all students) and restricted electives (courses selected from a curated list of approved electives). You'll be able to round it all out with some unrestricted electives (courses you get to pick yourself).</p>

    [/tab] [tab title="Sample Courses"]
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>You will need a strong science foundation as a Sustainable Agriculture and Environment student, so you'll take first-year chemistry, math and biology before moving on to the subject-specific courses. There are too many exciting courses to list here, but some of the learning you can look forward to in this program includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>APBI 210: Vascular Plants</li>
        <li>APBI 260 &amp; 360: Agroecology I and II</li>
        <li>APBI 327: Introduction to Entomology</li>
        <li>APBI 402: Sustainable Soil Management</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To see the complete list of required courses for this program, please consult the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,897,1644">UBC Academic Calendar</a>.

    <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>Honours</h3>
        <p>If you're a high achiever, or have a deep and abiding interest in contributing to research, then the Sustainable Agriculture and Environment Honours program just might be the perfect fit. Admission to the Honours program is competitive. To learn more about this option, please consult the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,897,1446">UBC Academic Calendar</a>.</p>
        <h3>Minors</h3>
        <p>You may choose to supplement your Sustainable Agriculture and Environment major with a minor program, which involves taking courses in a subject area outside of your specialization. As an APBI student, you're eligible to apply for a <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,909,0#24933">Minor in Arts</a>, a <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,909,0#20393">Minor in Commerce</a> or a <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,909,0#20394">Minor in Science</a>.

        <h3>Dual Degree with Master of Management</h3>
        <p>If you are interested in complementing your LFS degree with a strong foundation in management, consider applying for the Bachelor of Science (Applied Biology) â€“ Master of Management Dual Degree. Please note: admission to this program is primarily available to students coming directly out of high school. Depending on enrolment, the UBC Sauder School of Business may release a limited number of spaces on a competitive basis to students who are going into their third year at UBC (or those who are transferring to UBC for their third year). For more details about this dual-degree program option and for information about how to apply, please see the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,199,961,0#21418">Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration</a> section of the UBC Academic Calendar.</p>
