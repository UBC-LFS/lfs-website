    [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>
            The Applied Plant and Soil Sciences degree integrates plant-soil-atmosphere systems with a focus on the science underpinning crop production and ecosystem management. As an APSS student, you'll have the flexibility to emphasize a major area of interest such as plant production and protection, soil quality, climate change, food security or land reclamation. Classroom learning meets hands-on experience in our rooftop garden, in urban community gardens and at the Centre for Sustainable Food Systems at UBC Farm.
        </p>
        <p>
            APSS combines your core academic courses with electives that allow you to focus on your individual interests. You'll have opportunities to develop your research skills and build your real-world skills through internships, practicums, co-ops and job placements. By the end of your degree, you'll possess deep competencies in integrating scientific principles and communicating these effectively to diverse audiences.
