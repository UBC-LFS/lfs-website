    <h3 class="intro">Do you want to study or work with in your career? UBC's Applied Animal Biology program is intended for people just like you. In this major, you'll learn about animal physiology and behaviour, as well as the role of — and ethics around — animals in human society. Gaining practical in-the-field experience, applying your knowledge to real-world biological issues, and building your research skills along the way primes you for graduate studies or a career in this fast-growing field.</h3>

    [tabs] [tab title="Why Study Applied Animal Biology at UBC?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>UBC's Applied Animal Biology program is flexible and practical, and provides you with hands-on experiences that prepare you for a career after graduation. Our instructors are passionate about what they do, and come from a variety of backgrounds, which means you'll be learning with professionals who are outstanding in their fields. It also means you'll get a broader awareness of career paths and opportunities to work with animals beyond the careers you've already heard of.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>If you want to study and/or work with animals, UBC's Applied Animal Biology program is ideal for you. This program gives you a broad background in the fundamentals of animal behaviour, animal physiology and related fields as they apply to farm, companion and other animals. You'll learn about the role of animals in human society, and examine the ethical, environmental and other issues that arise from our connection with them. This degree program offers training in the research skills you'll need for graduate work, and — with the appropriate selection of courses — it can even prepare you for admission to veterinary and human medicine. Throughout your degree, you will be offered a variety of opportunities to gain practical experience on farms, as well as in laboratories, animal shelters and wildlife rehabilitation centres. In Applied Animal Biology, you'll grapple with real-world biological issues, problems and challenges, and you'll study — and possibly even devise — real-world solutions to them. This experiential learning gives you transferable skills to take with you into the workforce, or into further studies at grad school.</p>
        <p>In completing your Applied Animal Biology degree, you will take a combination of degree requirements (required of all students) and restricted electives (courses selected from a curated list of approved electives). You'll be able to round it all out with some unrestricted electives (courses you get to pick yourself).</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Sample Courses"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Applied Animal Biology students need a strong foundation in the sciences, so you'll take first-year chemistry, math and biology before moving on to the subject-specific courses. There are too many exciting courses to list here, but some of the learning you can look forward to in this program includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>APBI 314: Animals in Society</li>
            <li>APBI 315: Animal Welfare and Ethics of Animal Use</li>
            <li>APBI 410: Applied Animal Health and Physiology</li>
            <li>APBI 414: Animals and Global Issues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To see the complete list of required courses for this program, please consult the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,897,1446">UBC Academic Calendar</a>.

    <div class="paragraph">
        <h3>Honours</h3>
        <p>Are you an exceptional achiever? Do you have a strong interest in research? Then the Applied Animal Biology Honours program just might be the perfect fit. If you're interested in a research-intensive career, including areas in veterinary medicine, biomedical science, animal welfare, animal reproduction and wildlife conservation, you may especially benefit from this opportunity. Admission to the Honours program is competitive. To learn more about this option, please consult the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,897,1446">UBC Academic Calendar</a>.</p>
        <h3>Minors</h3>
        <p>You may choose to supplement your Applied Animal Biology major with a minor program, which involves taking courses in a subject area outside of your specialization. As an APBI student, you're eligible to apply for a <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,909,0#24933">Minor in Arts</a>, a <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,909,0#20393">Minor in Commerce</a> or a <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,909,0#20394">Minor in Science</a>. Learn more about minors, including application timelines, <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/student-services/registration-program-info/#choosing-a-minor">here</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Dual Degree with Master of Management</h3>
        <p>If you are interested in complementing your LFS degree with a strong foundation in management, consider applying for the Bachelor of Science (Applied Biology) – Master of Management Dual Degree. Please note: admission to this program is primarily available to students coming directly out of high school. Depending on enrolment, the UBC Sauder School of Business may release a limited number of spaces on a competitive basis to students who are going into their third year at UBC (or those who are transferring to UBC for their third year). For more details about this dual-degree program option and for information about how to apply, please see the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,199,961,0#21418">Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration</a> section of the UBC Academic Calendar.</p>
