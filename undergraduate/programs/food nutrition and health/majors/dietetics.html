        [tabs position='left'] [tab title="Why Study Dietetics at UBC?"]
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>UBC's Dietetics program prepares you for entry into an in-demand profession, at a level that readies you to meet national accreditation standards. Dietitians aim to improve and promote health through optimized food and nutrition choices, and fill a variety of different roles, including nutrition care, management, or population and public health roles. Our graduates are highly employable in a diverse range of roles, many within the ever-expanding health care system.</p>
        </div>
        [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
        <div class="paragraph">
            <p>UBC's Dietetics major is the only dietetics program offered in British Columbia, and is different from the other nutrition-related majors offered by LFS in that it's a regulated training program for people entering the health profession. Admitting fewer than 40 students each year, it's a competitive-entry program that involves five years of study: two prerequisite years and three program years. You'll spend your fifth and final year doing internship placements that will develop your knowledge and skills in preparation for this exciting career. Once you graduate, you'll be eligible to practice as a registered dietitian upon application to a provincial regulatory body and successful completion of a national registration examination.</p>
            <p>In the Dietetics program, you will take a combination of degree requirements (required of all students) and restricted electives (courses selected from a curated list of approved electives). You'll also be able to take a limited number of unrestricted electives (courses you get to pick yourself).</p>
