    <h2> What you need to know </h2>
    [tabs position='top'] [tab title="Why Study Dietetics at UBC?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>UBC's Dietetics program prepares you for entry into an in-demand profession, at a level that readies you to meet national accreditation standards. Dietitians aim to improve and promote health through optimized food and nutrition choices, and fill a variety of different roles, including nutrition care, management, or population and public health roles. Our graduates are highly employable in a diverse range of roles, many within the ever-expanding health care system.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>UBC's Dietetics major is the only dietetics program offered in British Columbia, and is different from the other nutrition-related majors offered by LFS in that it's a regulated training program for people entering the health profession. Admitting fewer than 40 students each year, it's a competitive-entry program that involves five years of study: two prerequisite years and three program years. You'll spend your fifth and final year doing internship placements that will develop your knowledge and skills in preparation for this exciting career. Once you graduate, you'll be eligible to practice as a registered dietitian upon application to a provincial regulatory body and successful completion of a national registration examination.</p>
        <p>In the Dietetics program, you will take a combination of degree requirements (required of all students) and restricted electives (courses selected from a curated list of approved electives). You'll also be able to take a limited number of unrestricted electives (courses you get to pick yourself).</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Sample Courses"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The Dietetics curriculum includes general courses in both biological and social sciences, as well as courses more directly related to dietetics such as basic and applied human nutrition, food and food systems, management, and professional dietetic practice. Here's a selection of courses that gives you a sense of the learning you'll explore through this program:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>FNH 340: Food Theory</li>

    [/tab] [tab title="Degree Options"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Dietetics is a major within the Bachelor of Science in Food, Nutrition and Health. Due to the rigour of the program and its professional-level training, there are no minors or dual-degree options offered for Dietetics.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="How to Apply for Your Major"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The Dietetics major is highly competitive, which means you will need to apply if you wish to be considered.
