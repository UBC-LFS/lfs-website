    <h3 class="intro">UBC's Bachelor of Science in Food, Nutrition and Health spans the continuum from the production and processing of food
        to its marketing, consumption, and impact on community and individual health. Within the Food, Nutrition and Health
        program, you can choose your major to align with your interests and professional goals. Hands-on practical learning,
        opportunities to connect with industry professionals and collaborative problem-solving are just some of the real-world
        competencies you'll develop. Earn a professional designation, build a foundation for medical or graduate studies,
        or prepare for a career in global food markets — all of it is possible in Food, Nutrition and Health.</h3>
