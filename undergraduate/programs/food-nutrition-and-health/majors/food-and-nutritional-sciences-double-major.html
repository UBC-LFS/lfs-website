    <h2> What You Need to Know </h2>
    [tabs position='top'] [tab title="Why Take the Food and Nutritional Sciences Double Major at UBC?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The Food and Nutritional Sciences Double Major at UBC integrates content from both Food Science and Nutritional Sciences, giving you a solid foundation in the principles of food science with respect to the manufacture, preservation and quality of food products. You'll also explore the role of food in human health. After you finish this program, you'll be uniquely positioned to contribute to the development of healthy foods for optimal living — an exciting frontier to be working on in today's world.</p>
        <p>In pursuing this double-major program, you'll be eligible to apply for <a href="http://www.ift.org/cms/">IFT</a>, or <a href="http://www.cifst.ca/">Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology (CIFST)</a> scholarships, provided you're a member of the association.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The Food and Nutritional Sciences Double Major combines the core degree requirements of both the Food Science major and the Nutritional Sciences major. This program gives you a strong foundation in human nutrition with applied knowledge from the fields of food chemistry, analysis, microbiology, processing and engineering. You'll gain practical hands-on lab experience and training, and will enjoy many opportunities to interact with industry partners throughout the year, both through your coursework and through events hosted by the BC Food Technologists. The Food and Nutritional Sciences Double Major is a professional program accredited by the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). Widely recognized in the United States and increasingly here in Canada, IFT certification after graduation benefits your career by demonstrating your competency to potential employers. It is not, however, a requirement for employment in the field.</p>
        <p>In the Food and Nutritional Sciences Double Major, you will take a combination of degree requirements (required of all students) and restricted electives (courses selected from a curated list of approved electives). You'll also be able to take a limited number of unrestricted electives (courses you get to pick yourself).</p>

    [/tab] [tab title="Sample Courses"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>As a Food and Nutrition Sciences Double Major student, you'll need to build a strong foundation with courses in math, chemistry, biology and physics. In later years, you'll branch out and explore aspects of food and nutrition sciences in greater depth, like in the following courses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>FNH 300: Principles of Food Engineering</li>
            <li>FNH 350: Fundamentals of Nutrition</li>
            <li>FNH 398: Research Methods in Human Nutrition</li>
            <li>FNH 405: Microbiology of Food and Beverage Fermentation</li>
            <li>FNH 370: Nutrition Assessment</li>
            <li>FNH 371: Human Nutrition over the Lifespan</li>
