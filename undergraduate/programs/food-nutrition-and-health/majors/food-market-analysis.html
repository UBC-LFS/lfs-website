    <h3 class="intro">Imagine shaping a multinational food corporation's marketing strategies based on information you've researched and analyzed. Or advising on how to price a new product for the strongest sales. Picture the deep sense of satisfaction from influencing company direction based on your own wisdom and knowledge. It's entirely possible when you graduate from UBC with a major in Food Market Analysis. In this program, you'll combine food science skills with a thorough understanding of the management and marketing of food, diving deep into things like food policy and trade issues, managing risk in export markets, and the industrial structure of international food markets.</h3>

    <h2> What You Need to Know </h2>
    [tabs position='top'] [tab title="Why Study Food Market Analysis at UBC?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>The world of food is constantly changing — and change is coming faster than ever before. A career in food market analysis is fast-paced and constantly evolving; it'll challenge your capabilities to think on your feet, spot promising new developments in the sector, and make intelligent decisions. UBC's Food Market Analysis major in the Food, Nutrition and Health (FNH) program combines deep learning in food science with a fluid understanding of the management and marketing of food. You'll obtain a broad socioeconomic perspective of issues in land and food, and you'll be able to apply this understanding to the forces at work in the industry. If at the end of your degree you find you've only just scratched the surface, and if your interests lead you deeper, you can take your studies even farther by pursuing a research-based <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/graduate/">masters or PhD degree</a>, a professional <a href="http://mfre.landfood.ubc.ca/">Master of Food and Resource Economics</a>, or a <a href="http://mfs.landfood.ubc.ca/">Master of Food Science</a>.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In the Food Market Analysis program, you will merge the core courses of the Food Science major with enriched learning in economics, commerce and food resource economics. Throughout your program, you'll develop a core understanding of the fundamental principles of food science and its relationship with the management and marketing of food. Your work will see you applying the principles of economics and business management to develop forward-thinking analytical tools and an effective understanding of food markets. And when you graduate, you'll be prepared to take your expertise into the food industry with a special focus on market analysis. If you want to concentrate on certain specific areas within the Food Market Analysis program, or if you're interested in pursuing graduate studies in this field, you should consult your program advisor, <a href="mailto:rick.barichello@ubc.ca">Rick Barichello</a>.</p>
        <p>In Food Market Analysis, you will take a combination of degree requirements (required of all students) and restricted electives (courses selected from a curated list of approved electives). You'll also be able to take a limited number of unrestricted electives (courses you get to pick yourself).</p>
