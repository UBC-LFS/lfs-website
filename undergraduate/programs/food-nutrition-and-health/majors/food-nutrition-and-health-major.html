    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>UBC's Food, Nutrition and Health program gives you the space to pursue your own interests while gaining a deeper knowledge and perspective of the food system, including issues related to food production, food security and the role of nutrition in disease prevention. With a wide variety of electives to choose from, you'll develop a customized program that balances content between applied nutrition courses and courses in the science of nutrition. Upon graduation, your FNH major will open doors throughout the nutrition field; our graduates experience a high level of employment in <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/undergraduate/food-nutrition-and-health/food-nutrition-and-health-major/#careers">nutrition-related jobs</a> within a few months of graduating.

        <p>In Food, Nutrition and Health, you will take a combination of degree requirements (required of all students) and restricted electives (courses selected from a broad list of approved electives). You'll also be able to take a number of unrestricted electives (courses you get to pick yourself).</p>
