    <h3 class="intro">Do you want to study or work with animals in your career? UBC's Applied Animal Biology program is intended for people
        just like you. In this major, you'll learn about animal physiology and behaviour, as well as the role of — and ethics
        around — animals in human society. Gaining practical in-the-field experience, applying your knowledge to real-world
        biological issues, and building your research skills along the way primes you for graduate studies or a career in
        this fast-growing field.</h3>

    [tabs position='top'] [tab title="Why Applied Animal Biology?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>UBC's Applied Animal Biology program is flexible and practical, and provides you with hands-on experiences that prepare
            you for a career after graduation. Our instructors are passionate about what they do, and come from a variety
            of backgrounds, which means you'll be learning with professionals who are outstanding in their fields. It also
            means you'll get a broader awareness of career paths and opportunities to work with animals beyond the careers
            you've already heard of.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>If you want to study and/or work with animals, UBC's Applied Animal Biology program is ideal for you. This program
            gives you a broad background in the fundamentals of animal behaviour, animal physiology and related fields as
            they apply to farm, companion and other animals. You'll learn about the role of animals in human society, and
            examine the ethical, environmental and other issues that arise from our connection with them. This degree program
            offers training in the research skills you'll need for graduate work, and — with the appropriate selection of
            courses — it can even prepare you for admission to veterinary and human medicine. Throughout your degree, you
            will be offered a variety of opportunities to gain practical experience on farms, as well as in laboratories,
            animal shelters and wildlife rehabilitation centres. In Applied Animal Biology, you'll grapple with real-world
            biological issues, problems and challenges, and you'll study — and possibly even devise — real-world solutions
            to them. This experiential learning gives you transferable skills to take with you into the workforce, or into
            further studies at grad school.</p>
        <p>In completing your Applied Animal Biology degree, you will take a combination of degree requirements (required of
            all students) and restricted electives (courses selected from a curated list of approved electives). You'll be
            able to round it all out with some unrestricted electives (courses you get to pick yourself).</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Sample Courses"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>Applied Animal Biology students need a strong foundation in the sciences, so you'll take first-year chemistry, math
            and biology before moving on to the subject-specific courses. There are too many exciting courses to list here,
            but some of the learning you can look forward to in this program includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>APBI 314: Animals in Society</li>
            <li>APBI 315: Animal Welfare and Ethics of Animal Use</li>
            <li>APBI 410: Applied Animal Health and Physiology</li>
            <li>APBI 414: Animals and Global Issues</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Honours</h3>
        <p>Are you an exceptional achiever? Do you have a strong interest in research? Then the Applied Animal Biology Honours
            program just might be the perfect fit. If you're interested in a research-intensive career, including areas in
            veterinary medicine, biomedical science, animal welfare, animal reproduction and wildlife conservation, you may
            especially benefit from this opportunity. Admission to the Honours program is competitive. To learn more about
            this option, please consult the

        <h3>Minors</h3>
        <p>You may choose to supplement your Applied Animal Biology major with a minor program, which involves taking courses
            in a subject area outside of your specialization. As an APBI student, you're eligible to apply for a
            <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,909,0#24933">Minor in Arts</a>, a
            <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,909,0#20393">Minor in Commerce</a> or a

        <h3>Dual Degree with Master of Management</h3>
        <p>If you are interested in complementing your LFS degree with a strong foundation in management, consider applying
            for the Bachelor of Science (Applied Biology) – Master of Management Dual Degree. Please note: admission to this
            program is primarily available to students coming directly out of high school. Depending on enrolment, the UBC
            Sauder School of Business may release a limited number of spaces on a competitive basis to students who are going
            into their third year at UBC (or those who are transferring to UBC for their third year). For more details about
            this dual-degree program option and for information about how to apply, please see the
