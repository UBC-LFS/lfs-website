    <h3 class="intro">Do you see yourself making a difference in the field of population and public health nutrition? How about health promotion or the health sciences? The Nutritional Sciences major opens doors to fulfilling and rewarding careers within this exciting sector. In this program, you'll study human nutritional sciences, learn about how nutrition integrates with other areas in health and science, and — should you choose to keep the inquiry going — be primed for deeper research at the masters and doctoral level.</h3>

    <h2> What You Need to Know </h2>
    [tabs position='top'] [tab title="Why Nutritional Sciences?"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>UBC's Nutritional Sciences major is specifically designed for learners who are interested in human nutrition. In this program, you'll develop a strong foundation in human nutrition that you can then build out into your area of greatest interest, whether that's in basic nutritional sciences, population and public health nutrition or international nutrition. After graduation, you can further develop your expertise through research-intensive graduate studies, or pursue additional studies in health professions like pharmacy, nursing, naturopathy, medicine, rehabilitation sciences and veterinary medicine. Your Bachelor of Science in Food, Nutrition and Health with a major in Nutritional Sciences also provides you with a strong foundation for a career in research related to health sciences, nutrition, and in public and private organizations related to health promotion.</p>
    </div>
    [/tab] [tab title="Program Overview"]
    <div class="paragraph">
        <p>In the Nutritional Sciences major, you'll explore content in basic and applied human nutrition, which ranges from broad topics in community nutrition right down to the finest details of how our bodies actually metabolize and utilize nutrients. Here, you'll experience rich opportunities to integrate nutrition with your interests in other areas within health and science, and you'll be primed to carry your education further at the masters and PhD level. All Nutritional Sciences students take the same core of courses, but you can focus your electives to delve deeper into a particular area of interest such as basic nutritional sciences, population and public health nutrition, and international nutrition.</p>
        <p>In Nutritional Sciences, you will take a combination of degree requirements (required of all students) and restricted electives (courses selected from a curated list of approved electives). You'll also be able to take a limited number of unrestricted electives (courses you get to pick yourself).</p>
    </div>
