    or visit the Museum of Anthropology free of charge. It's also a time of reflection: how has your LFS journey been so
    far? How powerfully have you expanded your network? What more do you want to accomplish, learn or add to your competencies

  <h3>Academics</h3>
  <p>Now that you're in your fourth and final year, most of your courses will be subject-specific and will allow for you to
    really focus on your passion. You'll be in the most program-specific academic year of your degree, so you should be loving
    the courses you're taking.</p>
  <p>You are a registration and academic planning pro by now, so you know that you have to plan in advance and ensure you've
    met all the necessary graduation requirements with your fourth-year academic plan. This way, you'll have enough time
    to make any necessary changes to your timetable.</p>
  <h3>Outside the classroom</h3>
  <p>It's exciting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's also a bit intimidating knowing there is potential uncertainty
    after graduation. If you haven't already been thinking about your post-graduation plans, be sure to pay special attention
    to events geared toward career prep, and continue to build and improve your career-ready skills through work and volunteer
    experiences. You may also wish to make an appointment with the
    <a href="">LFS Career Strategist</a> in Student Services to chat about your next steps.</p>

  <h3>To ensure you can
    <i style="font-size: inherit;">pasta</i> all of your courses...</h3>
  <p>
    Double check your
    <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/student-services/registration-program-info/#degree-navigator">Degree Navigator</a> to ensure you're on track for graduation, and notify LFS Student Services if you see any errors
    or have any questions. You don't want to be seeing little red Xs at this point in your degree!
  </p>
  <p>
    In your final year, undergraduate thesis or directed studies courses are good options if you're interested in research and
    mentorship from a faculty member. You can learn more about them
    <a href="">here</a>. If you've already written a paper and feel proud of what you've accomplished, consider submitting it to an
    undergraduate journal for publication, or presenting at the UBC
    <a href="http://murc.ubc.ca/">Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference</a> (MURC).
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're thinking about
    <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/graduate/">grad school</a>, you'll have to be mindful of deadlines and requirements. (You
    <i>have</i> been developing your relationships with your profs, haven't you?)
  </p>
  <h3>Deepen your
    <i style="font-size: inherit;">roots</i>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Now is the time to get out there and do all the things you have on your UBC bucket list! Monitor your Newslettuce and UBCfyi
    for events or activities that will help you cap off your UBC experience â€” there are truckloads of them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Reflect on what you've learned, and the skills and competencies you've acquired. Think about how you will present yourself
    to potential employers. Not sure how to pull this all together? Check out the many workshops and online resources provided
    by the
    <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/about-student-services/centre-student-involvement-careers">UBC Centre for Student Involvement &amp; Careers</a> to help you prepare for the next steps.
  </p>
  <h3>Apply for graduation</h3>
  <p>
    Whether you're graduating in the fall or the spring, you need to apply for that to actually happen. Familiarize yourself
    with the graduation timelines and next steps
    <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/graduation">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Get your grad photos taken so we can include you in the annual grad composite that hangs in the halls of the MacMillan Building.
    Check out the
    <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/lfsundergrads/category/graduation/">Graduation</a> section of the LFS Undergrad Blog for up-to-date info.

    You can request that LFS Student Services complete a graduation check for you (to confirm that you're on track and will meet
    graduation requirements) only
    <i>after</i> you've finalized your registration. Please send your request via

  <h3>To ensure you can

  <p>
    It can sometimes be hard to stay motivated when the cherry blossoms start blooming and you've already applied for graduation,
    but you're on the home stretch. (Or as we say in LFS, the crop is just about ready for harvest.) You'll want to finish
    strong, so stay focused and don't hesitate to reach out for help if you need it. It's never too late to access an academic
    resource that'll help you complete well.
  </p>
  <h3>
    <i style="font-size: inherit;">Lettuce</i> celebrate!</h3>
  <p>Attend your graduation reception and ceremony! Whether you walk across the stage in the fall or the spring, graduation
    is a special time of celebration with your family, friends, peers and the LFS community. We love seeing our students
    engaged in this powerful moment of recognition and accomplishment.</p>
  <h3>
    <i style="font-size: inherit;">Branch</i> out</h3>
  <p>You may be leaving the LFS nest (seed patch?), but you are always part of the LFS family. Come back as a mentor with the
    LFS Tri-Mentoring program, or stay active with the
    <a href="">LFS Alumni</a> by volunteering, offering presentations, or even hiring students down the road. You'll have a direct hand
    in shaping new LFS grads â€” and in broadening the excellence of our faculty's work</p>
