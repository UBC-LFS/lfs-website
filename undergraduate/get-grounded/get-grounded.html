  <h3>Time to get grounded, find your passion, expand your horizons and embrace all that LFS and UBC have to offer. In your second
    and third years, you will make more targeted choices about your academic path and build upon your science foundation
    from first year to focus more tightly on your specialization. You'll be taking more classes in your area of study, and
    you'll really get to know about the "systems" of Land and Food Systems through the LFS core series classes. This is the
    time to begin seriously considering potential career paths. This is also the perfect time to learn more about yourself
    and your interests as you get more involved in and find your niche within LFS and UBC.</h3>

  <h3>Academics</h3>
  <p>In your second and third years, you will start to build on your first-year science foundation and apply that knowledge
    in your subject-specific classes as they relate to your major (more about that below). In each year, you will take an
    increasing number of Faculty- and program-specific courses to work toward meeting your degree requirements. You will
    feel the difference in how you experience your academics as you build your expertise in your subject area. This is an
    exciting time of exploration and homing in on your academic passion!
  </p>
  <p>When you are eligible for second year, you will be prompted to select (declare) your major. In fact, you won't be able
    to register for classes until you do. If you didn't investigate them last year, be sure to explore which majors are available
    for your program:</p>

    Embrace the LFS core series and really go deep. The core series gives you a chance to work with students from all majors
    to collaborate with the wider LFS community on food-system challenges. You know how solving traffic congestion is going
    to take major thinking from urban planners, carmakers, environmental experts and maybe even psychologists in the coming
    years? It's a problem that no one industry alone can address. The same principle applies in food-system issues. The LFS
    core series aims to give you a more comprehensive understanding of food systems so you can learn how to create solutions
    that are sustainable economically, socially and ecologically. Learn more about it
    <a href="http://flexible.learning.ubc.ca/case-studies/lfs-core-series-builds-community-engagement/">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Make sure you're taking advantage of the different kinds of
    <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/academic-success">academic resources and supports</a> UBC has to offer. Even if last year was a success, there will always be new academic
    challenges and ways to improve.
  </p>
  <p>
    Look for ways to invest in your career preparedness along the way. Find ways to meet and work with your peers and community
    partners (the LFS core series will help with this); talk to your profs, peers and upper-year students to find out what
    courses are interesting and fun; and draw on UBC's amazing
    <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/career">career-prep resources</a> to get clearer on your interests and strengths. Within the Faculty, you may also wish to connect
    with the LFS
    <a href="">career strategist</a> in Student Services, or reach out to your designated program advisor (check the webpage for your
    major) to learn about opportunities in the area(s) you're interested in!

  <h3>Develop your

    looking for.
  </p>
  <p>Hoping to join the LFS Tri-Mentoring program</a>? This program gets you working with a more advanced student in your program
    as well as an industry professional. Talk about mentorship! Applications to the program close in mid-September, so you

    Re-familiarize yourself with the evaluation and promotion requirements for your program. This is a good habit to get into
    on an annual basis. You don't want to have any surprises in fourth year!
  </p>
  <p>
    Now that you've declared your major, you can use the Degree Navigator tool through your
    <a href="https://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/sscportal/">Student Service Centre</a> (SSC) to track your academic progress. It's good practice to check this any time you make
    changes to your registration so that you can alert LFS Student Services of any errors. Here's where you can
    <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/student-services/registration-program-info/#degree-navigator">learn more</a>
    about Degree Navigator.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do you want to build out your competencies by adding a minor? Look through the program pages to see what options are available
    for your program, and make sure you apply online by March 31.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you're considering graduate studies, now is the time for you to get to know your professors and/or look to gain research
    experience in labs. You'll need solid academic references by Term 1 of your fourth year. UBC Student Services has some
    <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/career/career-resources/networking">great tools</a> to develop your comfort level with relationship-building of all kinds.
  </p>
  <p>
    Do you plan on taking courses in the Summer Session (May to August)? Most students take a break over the summer and return
    to classes in September. But if you plan on taking summer courses, you'll need to review the schedule online in February
    and register in March, so make sure you do some pre-planning.
  </p>
  <h3>Develop your
    <i style="font-size: inherit;">roots</i>

    <a href="https://www.lfsus.landfood.ubc.ca/">LFS|US</a>!
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep shaping, clarifying and building your career path by attending
    <a href="https://www.facebook.com/lfs.aceteam/">ACE Team</a> and LFS|US events that focus on career development. It's high time to network with industry professionals
