    We are strengthened and enriched by our partnerships with the community beyond UBC's walls. In the Faculty of Land and Food
    Systems, these connections are of tremendous benefit to our students. As an alumnus or community member, we've got a
    ton of ways for you to contribute to our students' development as professionals — as well as your own — in the area of
    land and food systems.
