    <h2>Volunteer</h2>
    <p>Recognizing that it's not always just about the marks, UBC moved to broad-based admissions in 2012, where we consider
        a student's personal and academic accomplishments for entrance. We're pleased to offer UBC alumni the opportunity
        to volunteer as Broad-Based Admissions readers.

    <p>Have all those TED talks got you fired up? Excellent. Speakers get our students excited, too, with up-to-date innovations
