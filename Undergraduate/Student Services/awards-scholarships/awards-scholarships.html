  <h2>How to know if you are eligible</h2>
  <p>It's important to know whether you're eligible for a given scholarship or bursary. (For example, you will need to carry
    a minimum course load to be eligible.)
    <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,299,0,0">This page</a> in the UBC Academic Calendar walks you through the guidelines governing awards and scholarships at both
    the undergraduate and graduate level.</p>

  <h2>Applying for consideration</h2>
  <p>Many awards require students to not only be strong academically, but to also present other kinds of skills, passions or involvement. We can't keep track of every student, so we want to hear from you if you think you'd be a strong candidate for an LFS award! If you'd like to be considered for a recommended award, we encourage you to submit an application here. Please indicate on the form which award(s) you would like to be considered for.</p>
  <p>Please note, you must meet the eligibility criteria listed in the UBC Academic Calendar. Only those nominated for an award will be notified.</p>
