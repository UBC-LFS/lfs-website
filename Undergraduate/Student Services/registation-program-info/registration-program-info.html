    <h2>Student Rights &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
    <h3>​Student Declaration &amp; Responsibility</h3>
    <p>As a member of the UBC academic community, you are responsible for contributing your ideas and academic output in a shared experience of knowledge exchange and learning in a responsible and respectful manner.  When you accepted your offer of admission to UBC, you agreed to the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,285,0,0#15613">"Student Declaration and Responsibility"​</a> statement that commits you to abide by the rules and regulations of the University and affords you the rights bestowed upon students.  As you have rights and responsibilities, so too does the University, and it is important for you to understand what this means and conduct yourself accordingly; academically, ethically, morally and personally.</p>

    <h2>Choosing a Major</h2>
    <h3>What is a Major?</h3>
    <p>All students in Food, Nutrition and Health (FNH) and Applied Biology (APBI) will be required to declare a major; a major is a specialization in a single field of study within your degree program.  You will build on your science foundation after first-year and continue to narrow your focus over time, completing the majority of the courses required of the major in third- and fourth-year.  The courses required for each major are different and can lead to different career or graduate school paths, so it is important to review your options while in first-year so that you can make an informed decision about which major is the best fit for you.</p>
    <p>We encourage you to focus on your passions - if you love what you study, you will likely do better in your courses and lead to a career you're passionate (excited!?) about.</p>
    <p>Students in the Global Resource Systems (GRS) program choose a form of a major, by selecting both a region and resource specialization; the approach is similar in that you will build on your science foundation to build a program that curates your second-, third- and fourth-year courses to focus on your selected specializations. </p>
    <h3>When &amp; How do I Declare a Major?</h3>
    <p>You will be required to 'declare' your major when you log in to the SSC to register for your second-year.  The SSC will prompt you to select from the list of available majors associated with your degree program.  Majors that appear on this list are not competitive, meaning you do not need to submit a separate application or meet any additional academic criteria to be in it - you simply select one from the list, and continue with your registration.  </p>
    <p>There are some some majors that are competitive, however, (examples: Food Science or Honours Applied Animal Biology) so be sure to some homework and familiarize yourself with the requirements and deadlines.​​</p>
    <h3>Can I Change My Mind?</h3>
    <p>It's okay to change your mind - we want you to be in the program that reflects your passions.  Making a change could impact your course selection and degree progression, so if you are considering a major switch, it is best to consult with an Academic Advisor in LFS Student Services.  Changes to your major cannot officially be made mid-year. </p>

    <h2>Choosing a Minor</h2>
    <h3>What is a Minor?</h3>
    <p>In addition to your major, you may also wish to add a minor to your degree program.  A minor is secondary area of specialization that can complement your major, and adds up to 18 credits of coursework.  Depending on your degree program, minors are available in subjects offered through the Faculties of Science, Arts, Kinesiology and Commerce.  Due to significant course overlap or scheduling limitations, not all minors are available for students in all programs, so it is important to understand which options are available to you.  </p>
    <p>It is important for you to know that only 6 credits of the 18 credits can double count towards your major requirements.  This means that if you are interested in pursuing a minor, you will need to plan to take an additional 12 credits of coursework on top of you degree requirements.  This will likely extend the length of time it takes you to complete your degree.  </p>
    <h3>When &amp; How do I Declare a Minor?</h3>
    <p>Once in second-year, you are eligible to apply for a minor; you must apply to have a minor added to your degree program.  Some minors have limited spaces (examples: Commerce or Kinesiology) and require the completion of some per-requisite courses.  Applications are made directly to LFS Student Services and are due on March 31 of each year.  We commit to confirming if you have been admitted to a minor before registration opens for your next Winter Session.</p>
    <h3>​Do I Have to Declare Minor?</h3>
    <p>You are not required to declare a minor; the majority of LFS students do not complete a minor.  It really is up to you to determine what academic path would be most enjoyable, rewarding and beneficial for you.  </p>

    <h2>Restricted, Unrestricted and Health Electives - What's the Difference?</h2>
    <p>When reviewing the degree requirements of your program, you will notice both Restricted and Unrestricted Electives are required in all programs.  If you are in the Food, Nutrition and Health (FNH) program, you may also be required to complete Health Electives.  Here's what they all mean:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Restricted Electives (RE) are those courses you get to choose yourself, but only from a curated list of approved courses relevant to your major.  Each major has it's own list of approved REs, so go here landing page and/or link to list to be determined to confirm which courses count for your program. </strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Health Electives (HE) are those courses you get to choose yourself, but only from a curated list of approved Restricted Electives relevant to your major.  ​Each major has it's own list of approved HEs, so go here landing page and/or link to list to be determined to confirm which courses count for your program.​​</strong></p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Unrestricted Electives (URE) are those courses you get to choose yourself, and they can be from any discipline.  This is where you can explore your interests outside of your degree program; take a Music class, learn a new language, or brush up on your computer science skills.  As long as you meet the pre-requisites or restrictions for the course, you can take it!  The options are endless.</strong></p></li>
    </ul>
