    <h2>Registering for courses</h2>
    <h3>When do I register?</h3>
    <p>There are two different academic sessions at UBC: Winter Session (September to April) and Summer Session (May to August).
        You register for each session separately:</p>
    <p>Winter Session (registration for both terms happens in June/July)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Term 1: September to December</li>
        <li>Term 2: January to April</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Summer Session (registration for both terms happens in March)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Term 1: May to June</li>
        <li>Term 2: July to August</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enrolment Services will send you an email two weeks before your registration date for each session. This email will include
        your
        <i>personalized registration date and time</i>. This date and time will also be set on your
        <a href="https://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/sscportal/">Student Service Centre</a> (SSC).</p>
    <p>It is
        <strong>very</strong> important that you register on your specific registration date/time. If you miss your registration
        date/time, you may not get the courses you need or the sections you prefer, as courses fill up quickly. Make sure
        you set aside time in your schedule!</p>
    <h3>Plan ahead</h3>
    <p>Registration can be a bit stressful and overwhelming, especially when you're registering at UBC for the first time. There's
        a lot of information to take in and decisions to make. That's why it's important to plan ahead: think about what
        courses you need to take, what courses you want to take, and when you want to take them. You'll need to also make
        sure you meet the prerequisites and seat restrictions for any course you wish to register in.</p>
    <p>We strongly encourage you to make use of the worklists (draft timetables) available in your SSC, and test your timetable
        before your registration date and time to make sure the schedule you want is available. If not, you'll have given
        yourself extra time to adjust your timetable before you officially register.</p>
    <h3>What about transfer credits?</h3>
    <p>UBC Admissions awards transfer credits at the point of admission. You can find these transfer credits listed in your
        SSC once you’ve accepted your offer of admission, under the Grades &amp; Records tab. (Make sure you choose UBC–Vancouver
        as your campus to view the credit.)</p>
    <p>If you have received any transfer credit from another post-secondary institution, through AP, IB or A-Level credits etc.,
        we strongly encourage you to review the credit you've been assigned, and ask an academic advisor in LFS Student Services
        before you register for classes if you have any questions about how that credit was assessed.</p>
    <p>It is important to understand that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>not all credit you've taken will necessarily be applicable to your program here (for example, if you completed a
            whole bunch of Arts credits before coming to LFS, not all of them will help you meet your program's degree requirements,
            which may differ greatly from the credit you present);</li>
        <li>only a
            <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=2,25,74,0">maximum of 60 transfer credits</a> are permitted to be applied to your LFS degree;</li>
        <li>only the credit appears on your UBC academic record, not the grade you achieved; and</li>
        <li>you may be permitted to retake a course you've already received transfer credit for, but if you take it again, you
            will only receive credit for it once.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How do I register?</h3>
    <p>Enrolment Services has provided some helpful information on
        <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/registration/register-courses">how to register for courses online</a>. In addition, we have created detailed LFS registration guides just for you!
        Click on the guide that describes you best for step-by-step, program-specific information. If you follow these guides,
        you can't go wrong.</p>

    <h3>When can I drop or withdraw from a course?</h3>
    <p>You should drop a course as soon as you know you don't want to be taking it, as there are implications for yourself and
        your classmates if you remain in a course that you don't plan on completing. You will have a small window at the
        beginning of each term to confirm whether you want to remain registered in the course. During this time, you can
        drop a course without penalty and it won't show up on your academic record. If you withdraw from the course after
        the earliest deadline, the course remains on your academic record and the notation of "W" (withdrawal) is posted
        next to it. Ws are not used in the calculation of your overall GPA, and shouldn't cause any issues for you down the
        road with respect to admission to professional programs, graduate school or jobs.</p>
    <p>It is important that you mark your calendar with the published
        <a href="https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/registration/course-change-dates">add/drop deadlines</a> so you know when you can make decisions on your own, and when you may need to consult with
        an academic advisor in LFS Student Services.</p>
    <h3>When making the decision to drop a course, be mindful that:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>the tuition refund dates don't necessarily align with the add/drop deadline dates, so you will want to consult the
            tuition refund schedule online;</li>
        <li>it is your responsibility to be aware of when you are required to take a minimum course load (e.g. for housing, student
            loans, scholarship eligibility, athletics etc.); and</li>
        <li>if you are on financial hold, you will need to contact your Enrolment Services professional (ESP) to drop a course.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Answers to your top three burning questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Even if a course is full, space may become available as students change their minds or departments make changes,
            so it's important to monitor registration regularly if you are hoping to get into a course. Check out our FAQs
            to learn more about how and when to add yourself to a wait list.</li>
        <li>Yes, you register for both term one and term two at the same time!</li>
        <li>
            Although you don’t declare your major until the start of second year, you will need to take the necessary first-year (and
            second-year) courses in preparation for your preferred major.
            <ul>
                <li>If you’re a new-to-UBC student (i.e. a first-year student or a transfer student), you should follow the degree
                    requirements listed in the
                    <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,0,0">UBC Academic Calendar</a>.</li>
                <li>Returning students should follow the degree requirements as listed in their Degree Navigator. Not sure what
                    Degree Navigator is? Check out the info below!</li>
