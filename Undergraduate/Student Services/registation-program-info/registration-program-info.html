    <h3>​Student Declaration &amp; Responsibility</h3>
    <p>As a member of the UBC academic community, you are responsible for contributing your ideas and academic output in a shared experience of knowledge exchange and learning in a responsible and respectful manner.  When you accepted your offer of admission to UBC, you agreed to the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,285,0,0#15613">"Student Declaration and Responsibility"​</a> statement that commits you to abide by the rules and regulations of the University and affords you the rights bestowed upon students.  As you have rights and responsibilities, so too does the University, and it is important for you to understand what this means and conduct yourself accordingly; academically, ethically, morally and personally.</p>

    <h2>Choosing a Major</h2>
    <h3>What is a Major?</h3>
    <p>All students in Food, Nutrition and Health (FNH) and Applied Biology (APBI) will be required to declare a major; a major is a specialization in a single field of study within your degree program.  You will build on your science foundation after first-year and continue to narrow your focus over time, completing the majority of the courses required of the major in third- and fourth-year.  The courses required for each major are different and can lead to different career or graduate school paths, so it is important to review your options while in first-year so that you can make an informed decision about which major is the best fit for you.</p>
    <p>We encourage you to focus on your passions - if you love what you study, you will likely do better in your courses and lead to a career you're passionate (excited!?) about.</p>
    <p>Students in the Global Resource Systems (GRS) program choose a form of a major, by selecting both a region and resource specialization; the approach is similar in that you will build on your science foundation to build a program that curates your second-, third- and fourth-year courses to focus on your selected specializations. </p>
    <h3>When &amp; How do I Declare a Major?</h3>
    <p>You will be required to 'declare' your major when you log in to the SSC to register for your second-year.  The SSC will prompt you to select from the list of available majors associated with your degree program.  Majors that appear on this list are not competitive, meaning you do not need to submit a separate application or meet any additional academic criteria to be in it - you simply select one from the list, and continue with your registration.  </p>
    <p>There are some some majors that are competitive, however, (examples: Food Science or Honours Applied Animal Biology) so be sure to some homework and familiarize yourself with the requirements and deadlines.​​</p>
    <h3>Can I Change My Mind?</h3>
    <p>It's okay to change your mind - we want you to be in the program that reflects your passions.  Making a change could impact your course selection and degree progression, so if you are considering a major switch, it is best to consult with an Academic Advisor in LFS Student Services.  Changes to your major cannot officially be made mid-year. </p>
