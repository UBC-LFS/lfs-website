    <h2>Registering for courses</h2>
    <h3>When do I register?</h3>
    <p>There are two different academic sessions at UBC: Winter Session (September to April) and Summer Session (May to August).
        You register for each session separately:</p>
    <p>Winter Session (registration for both terms happens in June/July)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Term 1: September to December</li>
        <li>Term 2: January to April</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Summer Session (registration for both terms happens in March)</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Term 1: May to June</li>
        <li>Term 2: July to August</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Enrolment Services will send you an email two weeks before your registration date for each session. This email will include
        your
        <i>personalized registration date and time</i>. This date and time will also be set on your
        <a href="https://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/sscportal/">Student Service Centre</a> (SSC).</p>
    <p>It is
        <strong>very</strong> important that you register on your specific registration date/time. If you miss your registration
        date/time, you may not get the courses you need or the sections you prefer, as courses fill up quickly. Make sure
        you set aside time in your schedule!</p>
    <h3>Plan ahead</h3>
    <p>Registration can be a bit stressful and overwhelming, especially when you're registering at UBC for the first time. There's
        a lot of information to take in and decisions to make. That's why it's important to plan ahead: think about what
        courses you need to take, what courses you want to take, and when you want to take them. You'll need to also make
        sure you meet the prerequisites and seat restrictions for any course you wish to register in.</p>
    <p>We strongly encourage you to make use of the worklists (draft timetables) available in your SSC, and test your timetable
        before your registration date and time to make sure the schedule you want is available. If not, you'll have given
        yourself extra time to adjust your timetable before you officially register.</p>

    <h2>Student Rights &amp; Responsibilities</h2>
    <h3>​Student Declaration &amp; Responsibility</h3>
    <p>As a member of the UBC academic community, you are responsible for contributing your ideas and academic output in a shared
        experience of knowledge exchange and learning in a responsible and respectful manner. When you accepted your offer
        of admission to UBC, you agreed to the
        <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,285,0,0#15613">"Student Declaration and Responsibility"​</a> statement that commits you to abide by the rules and regulations of
        the University and affords you the rights bestowed upon students. As you have rights and responsibilities, so too
        does the University, and it is important for you to understand what this means and conduct yourself accordingly;
        academically, ethically, morally and personally.</p>

    <h2>Choosing a Major</h2>
    <h3>What is a Major?</h3>
    <p>All students in Food, Nutrition and Health (FNH) and Applied Biology (APBI) will be required to declare a major; a major
        is a specialization in a single field of study within your degree program. You will build on your science foundation
        after first-year and continue to narrow your focus over time, completing the majority of the courses required of
        the major in third- and fourth-year. The courses required for each major are different and can lead to different
        career or graduate school paths, so it is important to review your options while in first-year so that you can make
        an informed decision about which major is the best fit for you.</p>
    <p>We encourage you to focus on your passions - if you love what you study, you will likely do better in your courses and
        lead to a career you're passionate (excited!?) about.</p>
    <p>Students in the Global Resource Systems (GRS) program choose a form of a major, by selecting both a region and resource
        specialization; the approach is similar in that you will build on your science foundation to build a program that
        curates your second-, third- and fourth-year courses to focus on your selected specializations. </p>
    <h3>When &amp; How do I Declare a Major?</h3>
    <p>You will be required to 'declare' your major when you log in to the SSC to register for your second-year. The SSC will
        prompt you to select from the list of available majors associated with your degree program. Majors that appear on
        this list are not competitive, meaning you do not need to submit a separate application or meet any additional academic
        criteria to be in it - you simply select one from the list, and continue with your registration. </p>
    <p>There are some some majors that are competitive, however, (examples: Food Science or Honours Applied Animal Biology)
        so be sure to some homework and familiarize yourself with the requirements and deadlines.​​</p>
    <h3>Can I Change My Mind?</h3>
    <p>It's okay to change your mind - we want you to be in the program that reflects your passions. Making a change could impact
        your course selection and degree progression, so if you are considering a major switch, it is best to consult with
        an Academic Advisor in LFS Student Services. Changes to your major cannot officially be made mid-year. </p>

    <h2 id="minor">Choosing a Minor</h2>
    <h3>What is a Minor?</h3>
    <p>In addition to your major, you may also wish to add a minor to your degree program. A minor is secondary area of specialization
        that can complement your major, and adds up to 18 credits of coursework. Depending on your degree program, minors
        are available in subjects offered through the Faculties of Science, Arts, Kinesiology and Commerce. Due to significant
        course overlap or scheduling limitations, not all minors are available for students in all programs, so it is important
        to understand which options are available to you. </p>
    <p>It is important for you to know that only 6 credits of the 18 credits can double count towards your major requirements.
        This means that if you are interested in pursuing a minor, you will need to plan to take an additional 12 credits
        of coursework on top of you degree requirements. This will likely extend the length of time it takes you to complete
        your degree. </p>
    <h3>When &amp; How do I Declare a Minor?</h3>
    <p>Once in second-year, you are eligible to apply for a minor; you must apply to have a minor added to your degree program.
        Some minors have limited spaces (examples: Commerce or Kinesiology) and require the completion of some per-requisite
        courses. Applications are made directly to LFS Student Services and are due on March 31 of each year. We commit to
        confirming if you have been admitted to a minor before registration opens for your next Winter Session.</p>
    <h3>​Do I Have to Declare Minor?</h3>
    <p>You are not required to declare a minor; the majority of LFS students do not complete a minor. It really is up to you
        to determine what academic path would be most enjoyable, rewarding and beneficial for you. </p>

    <h2>Restricted, Unrestricted and Health Electives - What's the Difference?</h2>
    <p>When reviewing the degree requirements of your program, you will notice both Restricted and Unrestricted Electives are
        required in all programs. If you are in the Food, Nutrition and Health (FNH) program, you may also be required to
        complete Health Electives. Here's what they all mean:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Restricted Electives (RE) are those courses you get to choose yourself, but only from a curated list of approved
                    courses relevant to your major. Each major has it's own list of approved REs, so go here landing page
                    and/or link to list to be determined to confirm which courses count for your program. </strong>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Health Electives (HE) are those courses you get to choose yourself, but only from a curated list of approved
                    Restricted Electives relevant to your major. ​Each major has it's own list of approved HEs, so go here
                    landing page and/or link to list to be determined to confirm which courses count for your program.​​</strong>
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Unrestricted Electives (URE) are those courses you get to choose yourself, and they can be from any discipline.
                    This is where you can explore your interests outside of your degree program; take a Music class, learn
                    a new language, or brush up on your computer science skills. As long as you meet the pre-requisites or
                    restrictions for the course, you can take it! The options are endless.</strong>
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Tips &amp; Reminders:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>A RE can count as an URE, but an URE cannot count as a RE, and a HE can count as a RE or an URE, but a RE or
                an URE cannot count as a HE. (Clear as mud!?) It is important to choose your courses carefully. You can confirm
                your degree requirements in the
                <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,0,0">UBC Academic Calendar</a>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Be sure you're monitoring how many lower-level (100- and 200-level) courses you're taking; all of you need to
                complete at least 45 credits of upper-level (300- and 400-level) courses within your degree program to meet
                graduation requirements, so try to avoid front-loading your RE and URE credits in your first two years.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you are taking a course that is not currently listed as an approved RE but you think it should count as a
                RE or HE, you need to consult with your Program Advisor. Only Program Advisors can approve for a course not
                currently on the list to be applied to your degree program as a RE or HE. Approvals from Program Advisors
                are emailed directly to LFS Student Services so an Academic Advisor can update your Degree Navigator to reflect
                the approval. Without the written request from the Program Advisor, your Degree Navigator will not be updated.
                To find out who your Program Advisor is, please consult the individual major pages for
                <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/undergraduate/food-nutrition-and-health/">FNH</a>,
                <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/undergraduate/applied-biology/">APBI</a> and

    <h2>Can I take courses outside UBC?</h2>
    <p>Once you are a student at UBC, we expect you will complete your coursework at UBC. Therefore, you are not normally permitted
        to take courses for academic credit at other post-secondary institutions concurrently with your program in the Faculty.
        </p>
    <p>Permission is normally given only if you have previously failed a course twice at UBC. If this happens, you will be required
        to complete the equivalent at another institution to provide you with the best possible chance of successfully passing
        it. If you find yourself in this situation, we encourage you to connect with an Academic Advisor in LFS Student Services
        to discuss options as soon as possible. The earlier you meet with an Advisor, the more likely you are to avoid academic
        challenges down the road. ​</p>
    <p>In rare cases, the Faculty may grant students permission to complete courses at another institution. If you feel you
        present extenuating circumstances that warrant consideration, please consult with an Academic Advisor in LFS Student
        Services to discuss your situation. Please note that requests to attempt required courses of your program for the
        first time at another institution will not normally be granted. </p>
    <p>Written consent from the Director, Student Services in the form of a "Letter of Permission (LOP)" is required before
        attempts to register in another course are made. The Faculty is not obligated to approve transfer credit if an LOP
        is not obtained in advance.</p>
    To make a request to take courses at another institution for any reason, please complete the LOP Request Form ink to the
    LOP request form...yet to be created and scan to
    <a href="mailto:students@landfood.ubc.ca">students@landfood.ubc.ca</a> or bring it to
    <a href="http://lfs-ps.sites.olt.ubc.ca/student-services/">LFS Student Services</a> and meet with an Academic Advisor in person. To demonstrate good planning and preparation, you
    should be making this request as far in advance as possible. This will ensure the office has appropriate time to review
    and respond to your request; decisions cannot be expected on the spot.
