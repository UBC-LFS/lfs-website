    <h2>Why is it Important to tell an Academic Advisor?</h2>
    <p>​We know that what you are going through may be difficult to share, and you may not feel comfortable telling us exactly what's going on, and that's okay.  You are not necessarily required to share personal details with us, but disclosing what's going on to an Academic Advisor is important so that we can offer our support in navigating and explaining the academic impact of missing an exam, and identify and help you to access resources and support services that may help you during your time of need.  All details shared in an advising interaction remain confidential and we are very protective of the information you share with us.  The only time an Academic Advisor may share information is when a UBC-related resource needs to know in order to help you, and only then, only the details they need to know are shared. </p>

    <h2>Missing classes?</h2>
    <h3>Short-term absences from class:</h3>
    <p>In your time at LFS, you may experience a short-term illness that prevents you from attending class, writing a midterm exam, or completing an in-class test. If you need to miss class, you may be able to catch up on class notes by contacting a fellow classmate and sharing notes. Establishing a connection with your classmates early on can provide you with a support network for such instances, and we encourage you to do so. If you miss an in-class test or midterm, you will need to connect with your instructor directly and refer to your course outline for their attendance policies as soon as you can. LFS tudent Services staff members rarely get involved in these cases, but if further assistance is required please visit our office.</p>
    <h3>Long-term absences from class:</h3>
    <p>If you are facing health concerns that affect your in-class attendance for an extended period of time, the first step is to address them. If you are feeling unwell, anxious or low, there are many on-campus services available to you as a UBC student to access and receive support. In these cases, you may miss too many lectures to realistically catch up in your courses. When considering withdrawing from one or multiple courses, it is best to consult with an Academic Advisor about how this decision will impact you academically. You may also need to contact your Enrolment Services Professional to discuss any potential impact on scholarships or bursaries, your student loan eligibility, your residence contract, or your athletics eligibility. If the withdrawal deadline for your course has passed, you will need to consult with an Academic Advisor in to discuss a Late Withdrawal, which is a type of Academic Concession (see below).</p>
    <h3>Absence from a final exam:</h3>
    <p>You may experience an unforeseen event or illness that prevents you from writing a scheduled final exam. If you are affected by a family emergency, accident or illness, be sure to take care of yourself and access the support you need, then notify LFS Student Services as soon as you're able.  If you are dealing with a medical or personal situation that affects your ability to complete coursework or write a final exam, an Academic Concession in the form of a a course withdrawal or deferred standing may be considered (see below).</p>

    <h2>​What is an Academic Concession?</h2>
    <p>An Academic Concession is an accommodation or extension that is formally granted by Student Services to a student dealing with a hardship seriously affecting their ability to perform academically. There are two types of Academic Concessions that may be granted:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p><strong>A Standing Deferred (SD)</strong> may be considered when you have unforeseen circumstances or conflicting responsibilities that prevent you from completing final exams or final coursework. If your request is approved, an SD will be placed on your academic record to indicate that you have been granted a deferral for a final exam or final term work. You will usually need to arrange with Enrolment Services to write your final exam, or with your instructor to submit your final coursework.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><strong>A Late Withdrawal</strong> from a course may be granted in very exceptional or extenuating circumstances. A standing of W will be placed on your academic record. Late withdrawal from a course is not possible if you have written the final exam or if the course is otherwise deemed complete (some courses do not have final exams).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
