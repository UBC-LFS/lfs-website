    <h2>The UBC Academic Calendar: What is it and why do people keep referring to it?</h2>
    <p>The
        <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm">UBC Academic Calendar</a> is essentially the University's playbook: it's where all the rules, policies, course and
        program information is maintained. You will hear academic advisors, your instructors and your ESPs refer to the calendar,
        so it's important that you familiarize yourself with what and where it is. You'll see links throughout this website
        to the calendar entries that will further explain or define things for you. This might be a
        <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,0,0,0">
            campus-wide policy or regulation
        </a> that the Faculty of Land and Food Systems and you as the student are bound by, confirmation of a deadline you
        need to be mindful of, or specific content related to
        <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,0,0">Land and Food Systems</a> and your program of study.</p>
    <p>Take some time to explore the UBC Academic Calendar web pages. Feel free to chat with an LFS academic advisor if you
        have any questions — we're here to help!</p>

    <h2>Your responsibilities as a UBC student</h2>
    <p>As a member of the UBC community, you are responsible for contributing your ideas and academic output in a shared experience
        of knowledge exchange, and conducting yourself in a way that upholds the University's values of respect, civility,
        diversity and inclusion. When you accepted your offer of admission to UBC, you agreed to the
        <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,285,0,0#15613">student declaration</a>
        that commits you to abide by the rules and regulations of the University and affords you the rights bestowed upon students.
        As you have rights and responsibilities, so too does the University; it is important for you to understand what this
        means, and to conduct yourself accordingly — academically, ethically, morally and personally.</p>
    <p>The Faculty of Land and Food Systems and the University take allegations of both academic and non-academic misconduct
        very seriously, and trust that you will familiarize yourself with the actions or behaviours that would be considered
        in violation of your academic integrity or in violation of the Student Code of Conduct. The Faculty of Land and Food
        Systems follows the guidelines and processes set out by the University as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0">Academic misconduct</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,750,0">Non-academic misconduct</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Academic honesty and integrity</h2>
    <p>We only grow — as individuals and as a community — when we give our best. That means doing the work you set out to do
        as well as you can, by means that are honest and industrious. You're at the University of British Columbia, a world-class
        institution of higher learning and research. We are all here to expand knowledge, understanding and discourse, and
        we rely on each other to do it in a way that positively advances the human experience. Read more about UBC's expectations
        around academic honesty and standards
        <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/Vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,286,0,0">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>Plagiarism: What is it, and how do I avoid it?</h2>
    <p>You likely learned in high school to avoid copying information that you didn't come up with yourself. In university,
        we take it a few steps further. As you add to a given body of knowledge through your own research and thinking, you
        are now required to give credit to other people's ideas — not just their words — in a thorough manner. It's part
        of acknowledging that we're all in this together: you are sharing your own ideas, arguments and evaluations, and
        in so doing, you are building on the work that others have done before you. You are deepening the web of knowledge,
        recognizing the strands that have already been built while highlighting the little pieces that you're developing.
        On this page, you'll find more information about plagiarism, plus videos and tips on how to avoid it. We've also
        provided some specific examples for you on the LFS Wiki.</p>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about academic or non-academic misconduct policies, get in touch with LFS Student
        Services. If you find yourself in a situation where you're facing an allegation of misconduct, you may also wish
        to consider reaching out to the Office of the Ombudsperson for Students for impartial and confidential guidance.</p>

    <h2>Continuation &amp; Promotion Requirements</h2>
    <p>You are not automatically permitted to stay in LFS and UBC year to year; you have to work for it!  You each define success differently, but in order to continue in LFS from one year to the next you must maintain a minimum academic average at the end of each Winter Session, and in order to progress from one year level to the next in your program, you must meet a minimum overall credit load and have completed specific courses.​ </p>

    <h3>Sessional Evaluations:</h3>
    <p>The annual evaluation of your academic performance takes place in May, after your term two grades are posted, and is called "Sessional Evaluation."  During a Sessional Evaluation, LFS Student Services will review your academic performance (your GPA) and the courses you registered in (to confirm you are following your LFS program appropriately) and assign you the appropriate Academic Standing and Year Level for the next academic year.  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Passing Year: If you follow the degree requirements of your <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,261,0">FNH</a>, <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,262,20">GRS</a> or <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,897,1446">APBI</a> program as listed, and maintain an average of 60% or higher, you will be assigned a passing year, and likely promoted to the next year level of your program.  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Academic Probation or Failed Year: If you are missing degree requirements, or your average falls below 60%, you may end the year on Academic Probation or Failed Year standing and will likely not be promoted to the next year level.  If you find yourself in this situation, it is possible you may be asked to discontinue from LFS or withdraw from UBC.  </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>After the Sessional Evaluations have been completed, LFS Student Services will send you an email to notify you of your results.  It is important that you read the email carefully and contact us with any questions.</p>
    <p><strong>All details</strong> are provided in the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,795,874">UBC Academic Calendar</a>, and we strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with what is required year to year so you can avoid running in to problems.​​​</p>
