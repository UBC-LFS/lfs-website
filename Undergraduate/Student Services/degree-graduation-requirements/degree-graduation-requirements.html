    <h2>Continuation &amp; Promotion Requirements</h2>
    <p>You are not automatically permitted to stay in LFS and UBC year to year; you have to work for it!  You each define success differently, but in order to continue in LFS from one year to the next you must maintain a minimum academic average at the end of each Winter Session, and in order to progress from one year level to the next in your program, you must meet a minimum overall credit load and have completed specific courses.​ </p>

    <h3>Sessional Evaluations:</h3>
    <p>The annual evaluation of your academic performance takes place in May, after your term two grades are posted, and is called "Sessional Evaluation."  During a Sessional Evaluation, LFS Student Services will review your academic performance (your GPA) and the courses you registered in (to confirm you are following your LFS program appropriately) and assign you the appropriate Academic Standing and Year Level for the next academic year.  </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Passing Year: If you follow the degree requirements of your <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,261,0">FNH</a>, <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,262,20">GRS</a> or <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,897,1446">APBI</a> program as listed, and maintain an average of 60% or higher, you will be assigned a passing year, and likely promoted to the next year level of your program.  </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Academic Probation or Failed Year: If you are missing degree requirements, or your average falls below 60%, you may end the year on Academic Probation or Failed Year standing and will likely not be promoted to the next year level.  If you find yourself in this situation, it is possible you may be asked to discontinue from LFS or withdraw from UBC.  </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>After the Sessional Evaluations have been completed, LFS Student Services will send you an email to notify you of your results.  It is important that you read the email carefully and contact us with any questions.</p>
    <p><strong>All details</strong> are provided in the <a href="http://www.calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=12,194,795,874">UBC Academic Calendar</a>, and we strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with what is required year to year so you can avoid running in to problems.​​​</p>

    <h2>It's never too early to ask for help!</h2>
    <p>LFS Student Services is here to support you through the year to help keep you on track.  For example, after term one, we will reach out to all students who appear to be at risk of ending the year on Academic Probation or Failing Year and invite you in to meet with an Academic Advisor to explore options for support.  But, we don't want you to wait until things fall off the rails before seeking help - from the first day of class, whether you need tutoring to brush up on course content, or help with skill-development to improve your approaches to your studies, we encourage you to meet with an Academic Advisor to learn about the different resources available on campus you can access.  University can be hard, and you don't have to struggle alone. ​</p>
