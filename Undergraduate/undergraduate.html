        At UBC's Faculty of Land and Food Systems (LFS), we take an interdisciplinary approach to investigating and solving problems,
        because today's problems are complex. Working through them involves many different areas of expertise. In the Faculty
        of Land and Food Systems, our interdisciplinary programs power you toward an academic degree and prepare you for
        the working world.

    <h2>What Makes LFS Different?</h2>
    <p>We're not your everyday science faculty. Our small size and intimate groupings — like our Land One cohort — mean you'll
        get to know your profs and peers better. You'll study across a broader range than just in your own field, and learn
        to look for solutions in novel ways (hint: that's a BIG plus for employability). For example, you know how establishing
        a wind farm would involve engineering, geography, economics, IT, design, construction and maintenance? Well, land
        and food systems work the same way: the problems here require thinking and collaboration from a lot of different
        minds. At LFS, we understand that, and we look for ways to bring disciplines together as much as we can. Working
        with other people to address problems sharpens your competencies in curiosity, innovation and collaboration — all
        very valuable tools in a fast-changing world.</p>
    <p>Through your degree program, you'll establish connections with people in your own and other fields, which will strengthen
        your personal and professional networks — another arrow in your career quiver. LFS sets you up for tons of career
        development opportunities as you progress through your studies. Both in and out of the classroom, we're putting you
        in line with experiences that will set you up for career success. For example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>when you do a study exchange, you're not just learning content in a different location, you're building adaptability,
            communication and cultural competency skills that transfer to the working world;</li>
        <li>as you participate in a field study, you're applying knowledge in a hands-on way that adds to your work experience
            and value to employers;</li>
        <li>when you're working with a community group to solve a problem, you're developing the collaboration and communication
            skills that organizations so desperately need; and</li>
        <li>completing a co-op term builds on-the-ground skills fast, putting you directly in the professional arena and opening
            doors to more people who can move your career along. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>So engage with these different kinds of learning experiences as often as you can! You're in the driver's seat, and your
        LFS degree will be what you make it. Use it as an opportunity to develop yourself and your capabilities as much as
        possible.</p>
